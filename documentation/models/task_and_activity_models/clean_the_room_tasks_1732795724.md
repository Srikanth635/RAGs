**Summarized Query:**
Create a tree diagram detailing tasks and subtasks for "clean the room," including detection, sorting, and cleaning actions, and showing task dependencies.Creating a tree-based representation of the "clean the room" task involves breaking down the overall activity into smaller, actionable subtasks with dependencies. Here's a structured view of that:

```

### Dependencies

1. **Detect Areas**:
   - The first step involves surveying the room, identifying clutter (items out of place), and recognizing trash (items to be thrown away).

2. **Sort Items**:
   - **Organize Items**: Can only begin after detecting areas that need attention. This involves gathering similar items, placing items in designated spaces, and arranging any displaced furniture.
   - **Dispose Trash**: Involves collecting identified trash and taking it out, dependent on identifying it first.
   - **Decide on Items to Donate or Discard**: Requires decision-making about non-trash items, sorting them, and packaging donation items for removal.

3. **Cleaning Actions**:
   - All actual cleaning actions (sweeping, dusting, etc.) are dependent on items being sorted and cleared from the main sections of the room. Floor space and surfaces need to be free of clutter to proceed effectively with cleaning tasks.

This hierarchical structure not only helps organize the workflow but ensures efficiency by addressing specific dependencies between tasks.
