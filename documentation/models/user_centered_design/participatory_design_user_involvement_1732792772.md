**Query Summary:**
How do participatory design models incorporate user input, and can you provide examples where user involvement directly influences system features?Participatory design (PD) models involve users in the design process by actively engaging them as collaborators rather than as passive informants or testers. This approach emphasizes the inclusion of users throughout the development cycle to ensure the final product meets their needs and expectations. Here are how users are involved and some scenarios showcasing their influence on system features:

### Methodologies for Involving Users:
1. **Workshops and Co-Design Sessions**:
   - Users collaborate directly with designers and developers in workshops to brainstorm and prototype solutions. 
   - Example: In designing a new healthcare app, patients and healthcare providers jointly create user journey maps and wireframes during workshops.

2. **User Interviews and Surveys**:
   - Collecting qualitative and quantitative data from users to understand their needs, pain points, and preferences.
   - Example: Before redesigning an online education platform, current and potential students are interviewed to gather feedback on existing features and potential improvements.

3. **Focus Groups**:
   - Facilitating group discussions to explore user attitudes and perceptions about certain design elements.
   - Example: A focus group with elderly users might highlight accessibility issues in a banking app, leading to larger text options and voice-assisted transactions.

4. **Prototyping and User Testing**:
   - Users interact with prototypes to provide feedback, which informs iterative redesigns.
   - Example: In developing a new productivity tool, users test early prototypes, offering insights that lead to the inclusion of a task-priority feature.

5. **Contextual Inquiry**:
   - Designers immerse themselves in the usersâ€™ environment to observe and engage with them as they use the system.
   - Example: Being part of fieldwork, designers observe farmers using agricultural software, leading to the implementation of features compatible with low-bandwidth conditions.

### Scenarios Where User Involvement Shapes System Features:

1. **Educational Software Development**:
   - Scenario: Teachers participate in co-design sessions for a classroom management tool. Their insights lead to features like real-time student performance tracking and direct messaging functions tailored for student-teacher interactions, which were not initially prioritized by developers.

2. **Public Transport App**:
   - Scenario: Commuters are involved in user testing of a new public transit app. Feedback from these sessions reveals a strong desire for offline map access and live delay notifications, which become key features in the final product.

3. **E-Commerce Platform**:
   - Scenario: Frequent shoppers contribute to focus groups, where they highlight the need for a visual search feature. This input directly influences the design team to integrate image recognition technology, allowing users to find products by uploading photos.

4. **Urban Planning Tool**:
   - Scenario: Community members engage in participatory design workshops for a new urban development project platform. Their input leads to features that support interactive 3D models of proposed plans and forums for public comment, enhancing transparency and community involvement.

Participatory design is about harnessing the collective expertise and experience of users to co-create solutions that are more effective and aligned with real-world needs. This approach not only results in more relevant and usable systems but also fosters a sense of ownership and satisfaction among users.
