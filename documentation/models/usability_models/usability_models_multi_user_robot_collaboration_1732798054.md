**How scalable are usability models in complex, multi-user environments, particularly in scenarios where robots adapt to tasks like collaboratively arranging furniture based on multiple users' instructions?**Usability models can scale quite well to deal with complex, multi-user environments, but they require appropriate customization and testing to ensure effectiveness. Scalability of usability model requires certain factors to be considered like the number of interactions, the level of interaction per user, and the complexity of tasks. 

For example, autonomous robotics with AI have increasingly become proficient in handling multiple tasks and instructions. Through machine learning and pattern recognition, they can understand, prioritize, and execute tasks set by multiple users.

A theoretical example of robots adapting to multiple user instructions in tasks like arranging furniture could be something like this. Assume there's a multi-robot system with the task of collaboratively arranging furniture in a room. 

For instance, the robots employ a decentralized method where each one understands the global goal based on individual instructions. One robot could be programmed to move the couch and can handle instructions for its positioning and alignment. In contrast, another could focus on arranging chairs or tables. They prioritize their tasks based on factors like user priority and task complexity. 

If two instructions from two users contradict or are at conflict, the system could be designed to either give priority based on a predefined rule (like priority of the user or the timing of instruction) or through AI-informed decision-making based on previous user behavior or objective of the task. 

Neural-network trained robots are capable of adapting to the complexity of tasks and can even learn from previous tasks to fulfill future objectives more efficiently. 

That being said, while the achievement in this sphere has been remarkable up until now, there is still room for significant advancements. As the abilities of robotics continue to evolve, the scalability of usability models will keep on presenting new challenges and opportunities for improvement.
