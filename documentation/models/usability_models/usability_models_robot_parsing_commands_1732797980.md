**How can usability models assist robots with parsing complex natural language instructions like "sort and group the items by color and size"?**Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in robots is crucial in automating tasks that involve human interaction. Improved AI interpretative abilities can significantly boost performance, effectiveness and efficiency. Usability models can assist robots in parsing natural language instructions for better task clarity in various ways.

1. **Simplifying Complex Commands**:
The usability models simplify complex commands into a step-by-step process that makes it easier for the robots to follow and execute. For instance, take the task 'sort and group the items by color and size.' The robot processes this command in two steps: sorting items by color and then by size.

    Example:
    
    ```
    Command: 'Sort and group the items by color and size.'
    
    Step-1: Sort the items by color
    Step-2: Group the sorted items by size
    ```

2. **Eliminating Ambiguity**:
Usability models can help in reducing ambiguities in natural language instructions. They allow the robots to ask clarifying questions or take probabilistic decisions in ambiguous situations.

    Example:
    
    ```
    Command: 'Place the bowl on the stand.'
    
    If there are multiple stands, the robot might ask: 'Which stand should I place the bowl on?'
    ```

3. **Contextual Understanding**:
Usability models can facilitate robots to understand the context of the instructions, making them more adaptable and flexible to real-world situations.

    Example:
    
    ```
    Command: 'Close the door,' in the living room context means closing the living room door
    ```

4. **Handling Implicit Information**:
Often, instructions might not provide complete information. Usability models guide robots in making assumptions based on the most common human behaviors and task characteristics.

    Example:
    
    ```
    Command: 'Water the plants.'
    
    The robot assumes implicitly that it needs to fetch water, identify plants, and distribute reasonable amount of water to each.
    ```

5. **Learning from Experience**:
Usability models help in learning and evolving the parsing of natural language instructions over time by applying Machine Learning techniques based on past interactions and feedback.

    Example:
    
    ```
    If a command 'Switch the lights off' is often followed by 'Close the blinds', the robot learns to perhaps ask if it should close the blinds when asked to switch off the lights.
    ```
By allowing robots to better interpret natural language instructions, usability models not only make robots more efficient and effective, they also make human-robot interaction more natural and easy.
