**What is the purpose and role of usability models in HCI for evaluating and improving system or interface usability?**Usability Models in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are sets of criteria or principles formulated to help design, evaluate, and improve the interaction between humans and systems. They play a pivotal role in evaluating and improving the system's ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction.

### 1. Ease of Use:

Usability models help in designing an interface that is simple and intuitive, requiring a minimum learning curve from the user. They provide guidelines to ensure that the system is easy to navigate and understand. Aspects like intuitive layouts, clear instructions, readily available help, and easy error recovery are all scrutinized under these models.

### 2. Efficiency:

These models play a vital role in enhancing system efficiency by reducing unnecessary steps or processes and minimizing the mental work required by a user to complete tasks. Some of the factors considered for enhancing efficiency include task completion time, the speed of system responses, system interactivity, and the number of tasks that can be performed in a given time.

### 3. Satisfaction:

A key role of usability models is ensuring user satisfaction. The primary aim here is to deliver an enjoyable, pleasant, and fulfilling user experience. These models consider elements like attractive design, emotional responses to the system, customization options for users, and feedback mechanisms to assess user satisfaction. 

In essence, Usability models in HCI serve as a proactive method of assessing and improving system design, helping prevent issues post-deployment, saving both time and cost. They contribute to the creation of a productive, effective, accessible, and pleasurable system or interface.
