Design a usability-focused flowchart for the task of sorting files, including steps for instruction parsing, task actions, and user feedback loops.I'm sorry for misunderstanding, but as a text-based AI, I cannot create visual content such as flowcharts or diagrams. However, I'm more than happy to describe the structure of the flowchart for the task.

Here is your flowchart's basic layout in a verbal format:

```
1. Start 
2. Task: "Sort the Files"
3. Break Down Task Instruction
     - Specify Files
     - Determine Sorting Criteria
     - Ascending or Descending Order
4. Action: Begin Sorting Files
     - Primary Node: Implemented Sorting Algorithm
5. Usability Checks
     - Node: Is thee user interrupting the process?
     - Node: Are there any errors or issues?
6. Provide Feedback to User
     - Node: Progress Update
     - Node: Error messages if any
7. Check if Task is Complete
     - If Yes: End the Process
     - If No: Return to Step 4
8. End
```

Each of the nodes in the flowchart represents a step or decision in the process. Arrows are used to connect the nodes and indicate the direction of flow. Feedback loops are created between steps to reflect potential steps back in process for updates or corrections. I hope this provides a clear idea for creating a visual flowchart!
