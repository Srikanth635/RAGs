**How do usability models use user feedback to iteratively improve systems, and what frameworks exist for adapting systems based on usability testing results?**User feedback plays an integral role in the iterative refinement of systems, in the context of usability models. This feedback not only helps in identifying usability issues, but also stimulates improvements to enhance overall user experience. There are several frameworks for adapting systems based on usability testing results, such as User-Centered Design (UCD), Participatory Design (PD), and iterative design.

## User-Centered Design (UCD) 

UCD is an iterative product development methodology that involves users throughout the design process in order to ensure that the product meets their needs and is easy to use. 

1. **Understanding and specifying context of use**: This involves identifying the user needs and understanding their behavior towards the system.
2. **Specifying user requirements**: Here, based on the user's perspective, the specific requirements of a user-centered design approach are laid out.
3. **Producing design solutions and development**: The step where the system design accommodating all user requirements is created.
4. **Evaluating designs against requirements**: In this phase, the designed system is tested against the specified user requirements.

In each step, the obtained feedback from users play a significant role in determining the actions of the next step.

## Participatory Design (PD)

PD involves users as co-designers in the process and includes their perspectives and ideas in the design phase itself, rather than merely testing the design on users post-creation.

1. **Preliminary design phase**: Where designers generate concepts and preliminary design options.
2. **Participation phase**: Users participate in the evaluation and give their views on the design.
3. **Execution phase**: Design is implemented and any improvements based on user feedback during the participatory phase are made.

The feedback from users serves as a strong driving force as it directly architects the system.

## Iterative Design

Iterative design is a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining the product based on test results and user feedback. The main steps are:

1. **Design**: Developing a design prototype.
2. **Test**: Testing the prototype with actual users.
3. **Analyze**: Analyzing the results of the test.
4. **Refine**: Based on the results, refining the design.

After each cycle, feedback is collected, analyzed, and incorporated into the next version of the system.

All these frameworks adapt systems based on usability testing results, enhancing the effectiveness of the final product by making it more user-centered.
