**How do usability models integrate system usability with task-specific requirements, and what are some examples of systems designed with ease of task and minimal cognitive load?**Usability models are essential as they align system usability with task-specific requirements effectively. These models include aspects such as efficiency, effectiveness, learnability, memorability, and user satisfaction. By focusing on these parameters during design, a system ends up being more aligned with the tasks it is meant to serve, reducing the cognitive load of the users and increasing overall task efficiency.

For example:

1. **Simplified User Interface (SUI).** Many software systems like Windows and Apple OS focus on a simplified user interface, which reduces cognitive load for tasks. By making common tasks accessible and reducing unnecessary options, users can perform their tasks faster and more efficiently.

2. **Microsoft Office Suite.** Microsoft Office Suite applications - Word, Excel, PowerPoint - are designed keeping usability and task-specific requirements in mind. For example, Microsoft Excel allows users to do complex calculations and statistical analysis with ease, reducing cognitive load. Features like auto-complete, autosave, and error alerts help users address operational challenges promptly, thus making tasks easy.

3. **Google Search Engine.** Google Search Engine reduces cognitive load by providing autosuggestions, showing relevant results, and providing various filters and options to narrow down the search.

4. **Online Banking Apps.** Many online banking apps also focus on task ease and minimal cognitive load by providing user-friendly interfaces, making prominent tasks like balance checking, fund transfers, and bill payments easy to accomplish.

5. **E-Commerce Apps.** E-commerce applications like Amazon and eBay, showcase simplified product search and purchase processes, customer reviews, and easy navigation to reduce cognitive load and focus on task ease.

In conclusion, how these systems have been designed effectively showcase the application of usability models in aligning system usability with task-specific requirements. Their success further underscores the importance of including these aspects when designing any system.
