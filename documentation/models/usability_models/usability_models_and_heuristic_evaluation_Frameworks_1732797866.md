**How do usability models like Nielsen's Heuristics support heuristic evaluation, particularly through principles such as visibility of system status and error prevention?**Usability models provide a solid foundation for conducting heuristic evaluations in user-interface design. These models are instrumental in identifying possible usability problems in the design that might lead to user confusion or errors.

One widely-accepted usability model is Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics. This model consists of 10 simple, yet powerful rules of thumb, or "heuristics," for interactive design.

## Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics

Here are those principles with particular emphasis on "visibility of system status" and "error prevention":

1. **Visibility of system status**: This heuristic principle states that the design should always keep the users informed about what's going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. By providing real-time status updates, users can understand the context of their actions, which in turn decreases their cognitive load and enhances their overall experience.

2. **Match between system and the real world**: This heuristic advocates for the use of language and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.

3. **User control and freedom**: It supports the inclusion of 'emergency exit' options to leave the unwanted state without going through an extended process.

4. **Consistency and standards**: The design should not make users wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

5. **Error prevention**: This principle is about creating an error-free environment by either eliminating error-prone conditions or checking for them and presenting users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. This can be achieved by using safeguards like undo and redo.

6. **Recognition rather than recall**: The design should make objects, actions, options and directions readily perceptible.

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: The design should cater to both inexperienced and experienced users allowing customization.

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: The design should not contain unnecessary information which could detract from its overall usability.

9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Error messages should be in plain language, indicate the problem, and help to solve it.

10. **Help and documentation**: Help documentation should be readily available and easy to search.

## Conclusion

By using these heuristics as a checklist, reviewers can assess usability and user-interface design independently or as part of a team. These guidelines help focus the review and generate meaningful improvements, making the interface more usable and efficient, and delivering a better user experience.
