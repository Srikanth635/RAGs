#### 1. User Instructions:

1. **Identify the Book:** Start by first identifying the book that needs to be picked up. 
    - Instruction: "Locate the book that is required to be moved".
2. **Reach the Book:** The user should ideally move towards the book if it is not within arm's reach.
    - Instruction: "Please move closer to the book if necessary".
3. **Pick up the Book:** Now, the user should pick up the book securely. This involves reaching for it and applying enough force to lift the book without damaging it. 
    - Instruction: "Grasp the book firmly but gently, ensuring to not damage any pages. Proceed to lift the book".
4. **Identify the Target Location:** The user should then locate the table (target location) where the book is supposed to be placed.
    - Instruction: "Locate the table where the book is to be placed".
5. **Move to the Table:** If the user is not already at the table, they should move towards it.

6. **Place the Book on the Table:** User then should place the book onto the table gently.
    - Instruction: "Lower the book gently onto the table surface".

#### 2. Feedback on task progress:

To ensure the user is progressing well, there should be checkpoints after every action. Here, there could be possible implementation of a user interface after each step indicating them to confirm their progression:

- "Have you located the book?" Y/N
- "Have you properly grasped the book?" Y/N
- "Have you located the table?" Y/N
- "Is the book is now on the table?" Y/N

This series of Yes/No questions can help keep track of the user's progress in real-time.

#### 3. Verification of task completion:

At the end of all steps, the system should confirm the final state of task completion. This serves as the verification stage:

- Final Check: "Is the book resting properly on the table?" Y/N or "Please confirm that the book has been successfully placed on the table." Y/N

If the user is unable to perform any step or gives a "No" to any of the feedback question, the system should be pre-programmed to re-instruct and assist the user. If the task is successful, the system should acknowledge the completion and it can proceed onto the next task (if any) or end the process. Also, visual or auditory feedback can be really beneficial for the user to grasp the situation better.
