### Query:
How can usability models guide robots in verifying task completion user-friendly, including examples of confirmations like 'All items are sorted and placed as instructed'?Usability models can be instrumental in guiding robots to understand, verify, and report task completion in a user-friendly manner. They provide frameworks for understanding and designing the interactions between humans and robots, taking into consideration factors such as effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

1. **Effectiveness**: This indicates how accurately and completely the users achieve specified goals. A robot using a usability model would assess whether it has successfully completed all the tasks it was programmed to do. 

    For instance, if a robot is programmed to sort and place items, it might confirm `'All items are sorted and placed as instructed.'` This confirmation reaffirms the targeted effectiveness of the robot.

2. **Efficiency**: A usability model would guide the robot to complete tasks in the quickest and most cost-effective manner possible. The robot's ability to complete tasks without unnecessary steps reflects its efficiency.

    If we take the sorting example again from before, an efficient robot would sort and place items by expending the least amount of energy, time, and resources necessary. Here, efficiency and effectiveness go hand in hand.

3. **Satisfaction**: How comfortable the user feels with the interactivity of robots. Satisfaction would involve the robot communicating in a friendly manner that does not cause discomfort or unease for the user.

    For example, instead of the robot merely reporting `'Task Completed.'`, it might say, `'Job's done! All items are neatly sorted and placed as you instructed.'` This friendly interaction style promotes user satisfaction.

Usability models essentially bring a level of sophistication and adaptation to robots by instilling in them a deeper understanding of human interaction techniques and requirements. This results in more intuitive, effective, and satisfying user experiences.
