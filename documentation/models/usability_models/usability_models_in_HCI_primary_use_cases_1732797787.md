**What are the primary use cases of usability models in HCI, with examples such as designing interfaces, evaluating user performance, and optimizing workflows?**Usability Models in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) primarily serve to enhance user experience. Key use cases of these models include:

1. **Designing Intuitive User Interfaces:** Usability models guide the creation of interfaces that are easy to understand and use. For instance, the ISO 9241-210 usability model emphasizes the importance of user-centered design, which involves studying and understanding user behaviors and needs prior to interface design. The end goal is to craft intuitive interfaces that allow users to navigate and complete tasks quickly and efficiently.

2. **Evaluating User Performance:** Usability models provide robust frameworks for evaluating user performance. The model described by Jacob Nielsen, for instance, uses principles of learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction to measure user performance. This allows researchers to identify areas of the interface that are causing confusion or difficulty and make necessary corrections.

3. **Optimizing Workflows:** Usability models are utilized to streamline workflows, thereby enhancing productivity. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) is a model that helps understand usersâ€™ cognitive processes during task completion. By analyzing these processes, workflows can be optimized for speed and accuracy, significantly improving task completion rates. 

4. **Enhancing User Satisfaction:** Concepts such as user satisfaction and the overall user experience are key aspects of usability models. Building features that are tailored to the needs and preferences of users can significantly enhance satisfaction levels. For example, Hassenzahl's model of user satisfaction focuses on the aspects of hedonic quality, which includes elements like novelty and attractiveness.

5. **Improving Accessibility:** Usability models play a crucial role in developing systems that are accessible to all types of users, including those with varying abilities and impairments. For instance, The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) help developers create web content that's accessible to people with disabilities, such as visual or auditory impairments. 

It is important to note that the relevance of each of these use cases may vary depending upon the specific goals and target user base of a given product or system.
