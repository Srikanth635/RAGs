**How do descriptive models manage dependencies between subtasks, such as verifying an action before proceeding to the next?**Descriptive models, particularly in the context of task execution in robotics or automated systems, characterize tasks by specifying how sequences of actions should be executed, including handling dependencies between subtasks. These models can incorporate dependencies in several ways:

1. **Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs):**
   HTNs explicitly model dependencies by breaking down tasks into subtasks in a hierarchical manner. Each subtask is defined with preconditions that must be satisfied before execution. For example, in the case of gripping an object before positioning, the model would specify that the "positioning" action cannot occur until the "gripping" action has been successfully completed. This dependency chain is represented in the network, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order.

2. **Finite State Machines (FSMs):**
   FSMs represent tasks and their dependencies through states and transitions. Each state corresponds to a specific action or subtask, and transitions between states occur based on certain conditions being met. For instance, gripping an object transitions the system to the next state (positioning) only once feedback confirms the object is securely grabbed. Dependencies are naturally managed through explicit transition conditions.

3. **Petri Nets:**
   Petri nets provide a graphical and mathematical modeling tool for describing distributed systems, including task dependencies. They use places, transitions, and tokens to represent states, actions, and their progression. A transition (e.g., moving from gripping to positioning) can only 'fire' (execute) if the prerequisite conditions (e.g., a token representing a successfully gripped object) are present, ensuring the interdependent nature of tasks is respected.

4. **Action Description Languages:**
   These languages express actions with preconditions and effects. An actionâ€™s precondition specifies the conditions under which it can be executed. In this framework, an action like "positioning" would list the successful execution of "gripping" as a precondition. Dependencies are enforced by requiring that the effects of one action satisfy the preconditions of the subsequent one.

5. **Behavior Trees:**
   Behavior trees organize complex tasks in a tree structure where nodes represent tasks, conditions, or control-flow constructs, such as sequences or selectors. A sequence node mandates that its child nodes execute in order. If "gripping" is a child of "positioning" in a sequence node, the tree will only progress to "positioning" once "gripping" completes successfully, ensuring task dependencies are honored.

In all these models, feedback loops and sensors may be employed to verify the completion of one action before proceeding to the next. For instance, force sensors can confirm an object is securely gripped, enabling the system to confidently transition to positioning. This ensures robustness and reliability by integrating real-time data into decision-making processes within the task execution framework.
