**How do cognitive models incorporate different types of memory (short-term, long-term, and working memory) in task execution?**Cognitive models that incorporate memory into task execution consider multiple types of memory systems, each playing distinct roles in effective task completion. The primary categories are short-term memory, long-term memory, and working memory. Below is a discussion of how each of these memory systems contributes to task execution:

### Short-term Memory (STM)
- **Capacity and Duration**: Short-term memory is characterized by its limited capacity and duration. It typically stores information for about 20–30 seconds and holds around 7±2 items, according to Miller's Law.
- **Role in Tasks**: STM acts as a temporary storage for information that is currently being used or processed. During task execution, incoming sensory information and relevant task details are held temporarily to facilitate immediate comprehension and response.
- **Example**: When dialing a phone number just read from a screen, STM holds the digits until the task is completed.

### Long-term Memory (LTM)
- **Capacity and Duration**: Long-term memory is vast, both in terms of capacity and duration. It is responsible for storing information over extended periods, from days to an entire lifetime.
- **Role in Tasks**: LTM provides the knowledge base necessary for understanding and performing tasks. It includes declarative memory (facts and events), procedural memory (how-to knowledge), and semantic memory (meanings and concepts).
- **Example**: Proficiently executing a skill like playing the piano relies on procedural memory stored in LTM.

### Working Memory (WM)
- **Capacity and Function**: Working memory refers to the system that temporarily holds and manipulates information to perform cognitive tasks. It’s often considered an extension of STM that is involved in processing and reasoning.
- **Role in Tasks**: WM integrates information from STM and LTM, playing a critical role in reasoning, decision-making, and behavior modulation. It enables complex cognitive processes such as the manipulation of concepts, planning, and problem-solving.
- **Components**:
  - *Central Executive*: Oversees and coordinates the cognitive processes involved, directing attention where needed.
  - *Phonological Loop*: Deals with verbal and auditory information.
  - *Visuospatial Sketchpad*: Manages visual and spatial information.
  - *Episodic Buffer*: Integrates information across domains and links it with LTM.
- **Example**: Solving a math problem requires holding relevant numbers in mind (WM), applying learned operations (LTM), and managing these processes until a solution is found.

### Integration in Cognitive Models
Cognitive models such as the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) or Baddeley’s model of working memory utilize these memory types to simulate how humans perform tasks. These models often emphasize the dynamic interaction of memory systems:

- **Task Beginning**: Initialization relies on LTM for relevant task instructions or concepts.
- **Task Execution**: STM and WM are engaged in maintaining the flow of information required for real-time task management and execution.
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Feedback can lead to changes in memory traces, thus affecting future task performance.

In sum, effective task execution involves seamless interaction between these memory systems. STM and WM help track task progress and manage ongoing activities, while LTM provides the foundational knowledge. Understanding this interplay allows cognitive models to predict how humans approach complex tasks and how interruptions or cognitive overload might affect performance.
