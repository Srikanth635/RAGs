System-oriented models are frameworks that help understand and design systems by considering interactions among their components, users, and environment. Here are explanations of some key system-oriented models along with application examples:

### 1. Distributed Cognition
**Explanation:**
Distributed Cognition is a theoretical framework that views cognitive processes as distributed across individuals, artifacts, and environments. It emphasizes that cognition is not just confined to an individual's mind but is part of a system that includes interactions with tools, technologies, and other people.

**Applications:**
- **Aviation:** In cockpit environments, tasks are shared among pilots, co-pilots, and automated systems. Distributed Cognition helps analyze how information is passed and transformed between different actors and systems to enhance team performance and safety.
- **Air Traffic Control:** Controllers use radar displays, communication systems, and flight data to manage air traffic. Distributed Cognition helps understand how these tools combine with human operators' expertise to maintain the flow of traffic and ensure safety.

### 2. Ecological Interface Design (EID)
**Explanation:**
Ecological Interface Design is a design approach centered on displaying information in a way that leverages human perceptual and cognitive abilities. It focuses on creating interfaces that reveal the underlying structure of a system's work environment and support adaptive decision-making.

**Applications:**
- **Nuclear Power Plants:** EID can be used to design control room interfaces. Instead of abstract symbols, the interface might include visual representations that map to physical plant operations, helping operators swiftly understand complex system states and detect anomalies.
- **Process Control:** In chemical plants, EID provides operators with visual metaphors for chemical processes, allowing them to better perceive system dynamics, identify issues, and make decisions under pressure.

### 3. Task-Action Mapping
**Explanation:**
Task-Action Mapping involves designing interfaces where there's a clear and intuitive correspondence between tasks and actions required to perform those tasks. It's about aligning the user's mental model with the system's action model to minimize cognitive load and errors.

**Applications:**
- **Consumer Electronics:** Remote controls for TVs and media players are designed using Task-Action Mapping. The button layout and labeling map directly to the intended functions (e.g., play, pause, stop) to make the control intuitive.
- **Software Design:** When designing word processors or graphic design tools, icons (cut, copy, paste) are placed in a way that users can easily find and use them based on their task sequence.

These models are crucial for developing complex systems where human interaction is critical, as they help ensure the system is usable, efficient, and safe. By focusing on the cognitive and perceptual abilities of users, designers can create systems that support users effectively, especially in high-demand environments.
