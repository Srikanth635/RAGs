**Summarized Query:**
Create a flowchart for 'clean the table' task, showing interactions between system components and user instructions, including inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops.Designing a flowchart to represent the interaction in cleaning a table involves breaking down the task into components, detailing inputs, processes, and outputs with feedback loops. Here's how you can structure the flowchart:

### Components of the Flowchart:

1. **Inputs:**
   - User Command: "Clean the table."
   - Tools: Cleaning cloth, cleaning solution.
   - Environment: Table condition (degree of cleanliness, presence of items on the table).

2. **System Processes:**
   - Analyze Table: Assess cleanliness level and identify items.
   - Prepare Tools: Gather necessary cleaning tools.
   - Remove Items: Clear items from the table surface.
   - Apply Cleaning Solution: Spray or apply cleaning solution on the table.
   - Wipe Surface: Use cleaning cloth to wipe down the table.
   - Inspect Table: Check for remaining dirt or spots.

3. **Outputs:**
   - Cleaned Table: A table free of dirt and debris.
   - Feedback: User satisfaction or any areas needing re-clean.

4. **Feedback Loops:**
   - If the table is not clean, the system may loop back to re-apply the cleaning solution and wipe again or adjust the method if certain spots persist.

### Key Points:

- The process initiates with a user command and ends when the table is deemed clean and user satisfaction is confirmed.
- Feedback loops are critical for ensuring the table is adequately cleaned and any discrepancies are addressed efficiently.
- This flowchart offers a clear, systematic approach for automating or guiding a task like "clean the table," ensuring all necessary steps and conditions are considered.
