**Query**: What are the frameworks that explain collaborative interactions, including roles, responsibilities, and shared tasks in social and collaboration models?Social and collaboration models are developed to understand and facilitate collaborative interactions among users and systems. These models conceptualize how individuals or systems work together to achieve common goals, define roles and responsibilities, and manage shared tasks. Below are some of the notable frameworks and theories that describe collaborative interactions:

### 1. **Activity Theory**

- **Concept**: Activity Theory focuses on understanding the context of human actions and interactions in collaborative activities. It emphasizes that human activities are socio-culturally mediated and that tools, community, rules, and divisions of labor play vital roles.
- **Components**:
  - **Subject**: The individual or group engaged in an activity.
  - **Object**: The objective or goal of the activity, often transforming into an outcome.
  - **Tools/Artifacts**: Instruments used during the activity, including technology.
  - **Community**: The social context or group sharing the same general object.
  - **Rules**: Guidelines and norms governing the interaction.
  - **Division of Labor**: Distribution of tasks and responsibilities among participants.

### 2. **Distributed Cognition**

- **Concept**: This framework posits that cognitive processes are distributed across people, artifacts, and environments. Collaboration involves sharing information and tasks among individuals and tools.
- **Focus**: Analyzes how cognitive processes are supported and enhanced by interactions between users and between users and artifacts (e.g., computers, documents).
- **Key Elements**: 
  - Division of cognitive labor.
  - Transformations of information within different media and contexts.
  - Coordination mechanisms.

### 3. **Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**

- **Concept**: CSCW is a field of study focusing on how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by computer systems.
- **Components**:
  - **Groupware**: Technologies that facilitate group work, including communication, coordination, and collaboration tools.
  - **Roles and Responsibilities**: CSCW research examines how explicit and implicit roles and responsibilities are negotiated and assigned within groups.
  - **Shared Spaces**: The design of virtual environments where users can interact and share information.

### 4. **Team Cognitive Models**

- **Concept**: These models explore how teams process information collectively and how roles and responsibilities are assigned and evolve.
- **Components**:
  - **Shared Mental Models**: Collective understanding of team processes, tasks, and roles that influence team performance.
  - **Transactive Memory Systems**: A division of cognitive labor within groups that enhances memory and knowledge retrieval through known distribution of expertise and responsibility.

### 5. **Role-Based Collaboration (RBC)**

- **Concept**: RBC frameworks emphasize the dynamic and flexible assignment of roles in collaborative activities.
- **Components**:
  - **Explicit Roles**: Clearly defined roles that outline specific tasks, expectations, and accountabilities.
  - **Role Adaptation**: As circumstances change, roles can be adapted to better fit evolving tasks and goals.
  - **Collaborative Tasks**: Interdependent tasks that require coordination and information sharing among roles.

### 6. **Socio-Technical Systems Theory**

- **Concept**: This theory sees organizations as interdependent systems of social and technical components.
- **Key Ideas**:
  - An optimal balance between social and technical factors is essential for effective collaboration.
  - Systems should be designed considering both human contributors and technical elements.
  - Importance of feedback loops, continuous adaptation, and stakeholder engagement in systems design.

### Conclusion

These frameworks highlight the diversity in conceptualizing collaboration, each focusing on different aspects like cognition, social roles, technological enablement, or organizational structures. They emphasize that successful collaboration involves not just technology, but also social dynamics, clear communication, shared objectives, and adaptable roles and responsibilities. Understanding these models aids in designing systems and processes that better support cooperative work environments.
