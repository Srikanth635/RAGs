**Query:** How do models guide systems to adapt behavior based on user emotions and give examples of systems that change responses based on emotional states?Emotional and affective models guide systems to adapt their behaviors based on user emotions by incorporating machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and other AI components to recognize, understand, and respond to human emotional states. These models may use text, voice inflection, facial expressions, and other types of data to detect fluctuations in a user's emotional state, initiating a corresponding change in system behavior.

For instance:

1. **Chatbots and virtual assistants**: Tools like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant adapt their responses based on the user's emotion. If the user displays anger or frustration, they may respond more carefully or redirect to human assistance. 

   Example:

   ```
   User: YOU'RE STUPID! I HATE YOU!
   Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that, how can I assist you better?
   ```

2. **Emotionally adaptive games**: Some video games adjust their difficulty or storyline based on detected player frustration or excitement, enhancing game immersiveness and player satisfaction. 

3. **Automotive safety systems**: Emerging technologies detect driver fatigue or stress, responding with alarms, vibration or even automatic slowing of the vehicle to prevent accidents.

4. **Online Learning Platforms**: Platforms like ALEKS and Coursera can analyze learners' facial expressions or the tonality of their voice. If the system detects confusion or frustration, it might slow down, repeat a section, or provide additional resources.

These applications are continually refined as emotional and affective models advance, demonstrating the promise of a more emotionally intelligent technology experience.
