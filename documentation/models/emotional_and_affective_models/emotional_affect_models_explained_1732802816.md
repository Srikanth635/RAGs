### Query Summary

**Main Request:** Summarize different types of emotional and affective models and their applications in human-computer interaction.

**Specific Models Mentioned:**
1. Kansei Engineering
2. Affective Computing Frameworks
3. Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions

**Additional Requirement:** Explain each model and provide examples of their applications.### 1. Kansei Engineering

Kansei Engineering is a technique that translates customers' feelings and impressions into product design. It is heavily used in industrial and product design to integrate emotions and build a sense of attachment between users and products. For example, in the automotive industry, cars are designed not only based on functionality but also on the emotional connection the manufacturer wants the user to have, such as feeling powerful or sophisticated.

### 2. Affective Computing Frameworks

Affective computing is a branch of cognitive computing that focuses on the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. It is intended to implement human emotions into interactive systems. For example, user interfaces can adapt colors and styles based on the user's mood, recognized via affective computing. Moreover, in advanced healthcare settings, affective computing can be used to create systems capable of understanding the emotional state of patients, allowing for a more personalized treatment approach.

### 3. Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions

Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions is a model that depicts the relations among emotion concepts. It consists of eight primary emotions (anger, anticipation, joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, and disgust) and proposes that these emotions mix with each other to form different emotions. An example of its utilization in human-computer interaction could be designing a chatbot that not only understands the textual information the user is providing but also understands the emotion behind the user's text. This can help the chatbot provide a more empathic and personalized interaction, thus enhancing the user's experience.

All these models aid in the advancement of emotional intelligence in AI systems, thus providing a much richer and personalized human-computer interaction.
