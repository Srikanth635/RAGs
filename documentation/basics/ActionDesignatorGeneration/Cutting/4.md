Household Cutting Actions
## Dynamic Adjustments For Task Failures And Sensory Feedback
- **Tool Misalignment**: 
  - **Condition**: The knife or cutting tool is not aligned with the object properly.
  - **Adjustment Strategies**:
    - **Reposition the Tool**: The agent adjusts the position of the tool to realign with the object and ensure an accurate cut.
    - **Check Alignment Using Visual Feedback**: Use visual feedback to adjust the tool’s alignment before continuing the cutting process.
- **Excessive Force or Resistance**: 
  - **Condition**: The object is too tough or the agent applies too much force while cutting.
  - **Adjustment Strategies**:
    - **Reduce Cutting Speed**: The agent slows down the cutting motion to apply more controlled force and prevent damage to the object or tool.
    - **Switch to a Different Tool**: If resistance is high, the agent uses a more suitable tool, such as a serrated knife for tougher items.
- **Uneven or Inaccurate Cut**: 
  - **Condition**: The agent’s cut is uneven or not aligned as planned.
  - **Adjustment Strategies**:
    - **Reassess and Adjust the Angle**: The agent stops the cutting process, reassesses the angle of the tool, and adjusts to correct the path.
    - **Use a Guide or Template**: The agent uses a guide (e.g., ruler or cutting guide) to ensure more accurate and even cuts.
- **Slippage or Dropped Object**: 
  - **Condition**: The object being cut slips or is dropped during the cutting process.
  - **Adjustment Strategies**:
    - **Stabilize the Object**: The agent places the object on a non-slip surface or uses a hand to hold it steady before resuming cutting.
    - **Reposition Hands or Tool**: The agent adjusts their hand position or the grip on the tool to ensure better control during the cut.
- **Injury or Nicks**: 
  - **Condition**: The agent injures themselves or experiences discomfort during the cutting process.
  - **Adjustment Strategies**:
    - **Pause and Assess**: The agent stops, applies first aid if necessary, and reassesses their approach before continuing.
    - **Wear Protective Gear**: The agent uses gloves or other protective equipment to reduce the risk of injury during subsequent attempts.
