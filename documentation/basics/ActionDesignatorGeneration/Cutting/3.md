# Task Details

## Action Designator
- **Action Core**: Cutting
### Action Roles
- Agent
- Tool
- Object to be Cut
- Surface
- Result
### Required Action Roles
- Agent
- Tool
- Object to be Cut
### Motion Phases
- **Reaching**: The agent moves their hand toward the cutting tool and the object to be cut.
- **Grasping**: The agent securely grasps the cutting tool with an appropriate grip.
- **Positioning**: The agent positions the knife over the object, ensuring alignment.
- **Initial Cut**: The agent applies force to the knife to begin cutting through the object.
- **Continual Cutting**: The agent continues cutting with consistent pressure, maintaining control.
- **Final Cut**: The agent completes the cut, separating the object into desired parts.
- **Release**: The agent releases the tool and completes the action.
### Real Time Feedback Mechanisms
- **real_time_feedback_mechanisms**: Monitors the alignment of the cutting tool and checks the cut's accuracy in real time.
- **real_time_feedback_mechanisms**: Senses resistance from the object to guide the agent in adjusting force or motion.
- **real_time_feedback_mechanisms**: Provides feedback from the agentâ€™s hand and arm to ensure proper tool grip and cutting motion.
- **real_time_feedback_mechanisms**: The sound of the cutting process indicates whether the tool is cutting efficiently or if adjustments are needed.
- **Cram Plan**: (perform (an action (type cut-object) (an object (type {object_to_be_cut}){object_props})(tool (type {tool}){tool_props})(result (type {result}){result_props})) (motion (phase reaching) (phase grasping) (phase positioning) (phase initial-cut) (phase continual-cut) (phase final-cut) (phase release)) (real-time-feedback (visual) (tactile) (proprioceptive) (auditory)))
