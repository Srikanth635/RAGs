# Task Details

## Action Designator
- **Action Core**: Cutting
### Action Roles
- Agent
- Tool
- Object to be Cut
- Surface
- Result
### Required Action Roles
- Agent
- Tool
- Object to be Cut
### Motion Phases
- **Preparation**: Position the object (e.g., food) securely on a stable surface, ready for cutting.
- **Tool Grip**: The agent grips the cutting tool (e.g., knife) firmly with the proper hand position.
- **Initial Cut**: The agent applies force to the knife, moving it down and through the object with controlled precision.
- **Continual Cutting**: The agent continues applying force and controlled motion, following through with the cut to divide the object into smaller parts.
- **Completion**: The agent finishes the cut, lifts the knife away from the surface, and checks the result.
### Sensory Feedback
- **sensory_feedback**: Used to guide the agent's movements, ensuring that the knife follows the desired cut line and achieves an even division.
- **sensory_feedback**: Helps the agent assess the resistance of the object being cut, allowing for adjustment in force and motion.
- **sensory_feedback**: Provides feedback on the knife's position in the agent's hand and the stability of the object being cut.
- **sensory_feedback**: The sound of the knife cutting through the object provides feedback on the ease of cutting and the need to adjust force.
- **Cram Plan**: (perform (an action (type cut-object) (an object (type {object_to_be_cut}){object_props})(tool (type {tool}){tool_props})(result (type {result}){result_props})) (motion (phase preparation) (phase tool-grip) (phase initial-cut) (phase continual-cut) (phase completion)))
