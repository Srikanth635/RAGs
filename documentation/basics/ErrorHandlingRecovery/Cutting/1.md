# Cutting

## Task
Cutting
## Common Errors And Failures
- **Uneven Cuts**: 
  - Solution: Apply consistent pressure and use a steady cutting motion.
  - Cause: Inconsistent pressure or improper technique.
  - Detection: Visual inspection of the cut surface shows uneven or jagged edges.
- **Slipping Knife**: 
  - Solution: Ensure a secure grip and maintain a proper cutting angle.
  - Cause: Poor grip or incorrect angle of the knife.
  - Detection: Knife moves unexpectedly or causes injury due to slippage.
- **Cutting Too Deep or Shallow**: 
  - Solution: Adjust the cutting pressure and check the depth regularly during cutting.
  - Cause: Lack of control over the cutting tool.
  - Detection: Visible cuts that are deeper or shallower than intended, resulting in an uneven or incomplete cut.
- **Injury or Nicks**: 
  - Solution: Use proper cutting techniques, ensure fingers are out of the way, and wear protective gloves if necessary.
  - Cause: Inadvertent contact with the cutting edge.
  - Detection: Pain, bleeding, or sudden discomfort upon contact with the knife.
- **Over-cutting or Cutting Through the Surface**: 
  - Solution: Control the force and ensure the tool is used at the correct angle to avoid cutting through unintended surfaces.
  - Cause: Excessive force or incorrect alignment.
  - Detection: Damage to the surface underneath the object being cut, such as a cutting board being scored.
- **Object Slips While Cutting**: 
  - Solution: Stabilize the object using a non-slip mat or a proper grip to prevent movement.
  - Cause: Improper stabilization of the object.
  - Detection: The object shifts or moves during cutting, leading to a loss of control.
- **Tool Becoming Dull**: 
  - Solution: Regularly sharpen the cutting tool and ensure proper maintenance.
  - Cause: Lack of tool maintenance or improper use.
  - Detection: Difficulty in cutting, with noticeable increased force needed and rough edges on the object.
- **Excessive Force or Tension**: 
  - Solution: Apply appropriate force and ensure the tool is suited for the material being cut.
  - Cause: Rushing or improper handling of the cutting tool.
  - Detection: Broken or bent tools, or unintended marks on the object.
- **Misaligned Cut**: 
  - Solution: Use guides, rulers, or draw clear lines to follow when cutting.
  - Cause: Not following a guide or cutting line properly.
  - Detection: Visible misalignment in the cut, deviating from the intended path.
- **Cutting the Wrong Object**: 
  - Solution: Double-check the object to be cut and focus on the task to avoid confusion.
  - Cause: Lack of attention or focus.
  - Detection: Object is cut incorrectly, or an unintended object is cut.
