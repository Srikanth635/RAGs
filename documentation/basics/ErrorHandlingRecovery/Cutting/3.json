      "strategy": "Adjust Pressure",
      "description": "Reduce or increase the pressure applied to the tool to maintain control and avoid mishaps.",
      "example": "If the knife is difficult to cut through a material, reduce pressure to prevent damage."

    {
      "strategy": "Stabilize the Object",
      "description": "Ensure the object is properly secured to prevent movement during cutting.",
      "example": "Place the object on a non-slip surface or use a clamp to prevent it from shifting."

    {
      "strategy": "Sharpen the Tool",
      "description": "If the tool has become dull, sharpen it to restore effective cutting performance.",
      "example": "If resistance increases, sharpen the knife blade to continue cutting smoothly."

    {
      "strategy": "Pause and Reassess",
      "description": "Take a moment to stop, assess the situation, and adjust the cutting strategy accordingly.",
      "example": "If a cut is not aligned properly, stop and adjust the angle before continuing."

    {
      "strategy": "Reposition the Object",
      "description": "Adjust the object's position to improve accessibility or stability for better cutting.",
      "example": "Move the object slightly if it's at an awkward angle to make the cut easier."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "Slow Down and Focus",
      "description": "Reduce the cutting speed to increase control and minimize errors.",
      "example": "If the cut is uneven, slow down and apply more careful, controlled movements."

    {
      "strategy": "Switch Tools",
      "description": "If the current tool is ineffective, switch to a more appropriate or sharper tool.",
      "example": "If a serrated knife isn't cutting properly, switch to a chefâ€™s knife for better precision."

      "strategy": "Use Guides or Templates",
      "description": "Use visual guides or templates to help stay on track during the cut.",
      "example": "Use a ruler or stencil to guide a straight line for even cuts."

      "strategy": "Minimize Distractions",
      "description": "Remove any distractions or interruptions that could lead to further mistakes.",
