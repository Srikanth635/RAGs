# Cutting

## Task
Cutting
## Visual Feedback Mechanisms
- **Blade Alignment**: Ensures the cutting tool is aligned correctly with the object.
  - Examples: Knife positioned straight on a vegetable, Scissors aligned with a fabric edge
- **Cutting Depth**: Provides feedback on how deep the cut is progressing.
  - Examples: Visible depth of a knife in a loaf of bread, Cutting through layers of a cake
- **Cut Quality**: Monitors the smoothness and uniformity of the cut.
  - Examples: Clean edges on sliced fruit, Even width of julienne vegetables
- **Material Separation**: Observes how the material separates during cutting.
  - Examples: Peel separating from a fruit, Meat portions being divided
- **Tool Trajectory**: Tracks the motion of the cutting tool to ensure precision.
  - Examples: Straight cutting line on cardboard, Circular motion for pizza cutting
- **Surface Interaction**: Monitors how the object interacts with the cutting surface.
  - Examples: Object slipping on a cutting board, Stable position during slicing
- **Object Integrity**: Ensures the uncut parts of the object remain intact.
  - Examples: Whole apple core intact after slicing, Bread loaf maintains shape after cutting
- **Color Changes**: Observes color variations to assess cutting progress.
  - Examples: Inside color of an onion revealed after peeling layers, Inner layers of a cake after slicing
- **Edge Visibility**: Tracks the edges of the object to guide cutting paths.
  - Examples: Following the edge of a crust on a pie, Tracing the outline of a stencil
- **Object Movement**: Detects any movement of the object during cutting.
  - Examples: Object sliding on a cutting board, Rolling fruit while being sliced
