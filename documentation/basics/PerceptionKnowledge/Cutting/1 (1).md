# Cutting

## Task
Cutting
## Object State Detection
### Steps
- **Capture Image**: Acquire an image of the object using a camera or vision sensor.
  - Inputs: Lighting conditions, Camera position
  - Output: Raw image of the object
- **Preprocess Image**: Enhance the image for better analysis by adjusting brightness, contrast, and removing noise.
  - Inputs: Raw image
  - Output: Preprocessed image ready for analysis
- **Segment Object**: Identify the object and separate it from the background using segmentation techniques.
  - Inputs: Preprocessed image
  - Output: Segmented object region
- **Analyze Texture and Color**: Examine the texture and color patterns of the object to determine its state.
  - Inputs: Segmented object region
  - Output: Information on surface characteristics
- **Estimate Volume or Contents**: Use shape and size analysis to infer if the object is filled, partially filled, or empty.
  - Inputs: 3D shape reconstruction, Volume estimation algorithms
  - Output: State of the object (e.g., filled, empty)
- **Compare with Reference**: Compare detected state with known reference states to validate the object's condition.
  - Inputs: Detected state, Reference dataset
  - Output: Validated object state
- **Highlight Cutting Area**: Determine appropriate areas for cutting based on the detected state and task requirements.
  - Inputs: Validated object state, Task parameters
  - Output: Cutting area marked
