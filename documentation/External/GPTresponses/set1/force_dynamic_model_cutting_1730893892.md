What is the force dynamic model of everyday actions like cutting?The force dynamic model of everyday manipulation actions, such as cutting, is a conceptual framework derived from cognitive linguistics and psychology. It is used to describe how humans perceive and understand the physical interactions involved in manipulating objects. This model primarily focuses on the forces and interactions at play during these actions, emphasizing the causal relationships and the dynamic changes in state that occur.

### Key Concepts of the Force Dynamic Model:

1. **Forces and Entities**:
   - **Agonist**: The force or entity exerting the action. For example, in cutting, this could be the hand applying force to a knife.
   - **Antagonist**: The opposing force or resistance. In cutting, this could be the material being cut, like a piece of bread or fabric.

2. **Types of Forces**:
   - **Internal Forces**: Generated by the person or tool performing the action (e.g., the hand's force on the knife).
   - **External Forces**: Environmental or object-specific resistances (e.g., the material's resistance to being cut).

3. **Interactions**:
   - The model highlights how entities interact through contact and non-contact forces, focusing on the opposition, removal, or overcoming of obstacles during manipulation.

4. **Causality and Change**:
   - Emphasizes the causal relationship between the applied force and the resulting change in the object being manipulated.
   - In cutting, the force applied by the knife (agonist) results in the separation of the object being cut (antagonist).

5. **Goal-driven Actions**:
   - Actions are seen as goal-driven, aiming to achieve a specific outcome, such as altering the material's shape or state.

6. **Dynamic Interaction**:
   - It considers how these interactions themselves change dynamically over time (e.g., how the force needed may decrease as the object is progressively cut through).

The force dynamic model is helpful in understanding physical manipulation not just as mere mechanical interactions but as cognitively rich processes involving perception, intention, and adaptation. It is particularly useful in designing artificial intelligence and robotic systems for real-world physical manipulation, as it can provide insights into how humans intuitively handle complex physical tasks.
