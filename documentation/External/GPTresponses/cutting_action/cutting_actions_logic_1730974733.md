**Summarize common success and error predicates for cutting actions in logical terms:**

- Define error conditions like `Blunt(tool)` indicating a tool is too dull.
- Define success conditions like `CleanCut(object)` based on tool and material compatibility.To define logical statements for common success and error conditions in cutting actions, we can utilize predicates. In logic, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. Below are some predicates that can represent error and success conditions related to cutting actions involving tools and materials:

### Predicates Definitions

1. **Blunt(tool):** Represents the condition where a tool is not sharp enough to perform a cutting task.
   - Example: `Blunt(knife)` means that the knife is blunt.

2. **MaterialCompatible(tool, material):** Indicates that a tool is compatible with cutting a particular material.
   - Example: `MaterialCompatible(scissors, paper)`

3. **ToolOperational(tool):** States that a tool is in good working condition (e.g., not broken, stuck, or blunt).
   - Example: `ToolOperational(saw)`

4. **CleanCut(object):** Represents the condition where a cut on the object was successful and clean.
   - Example: `CleanCut(fabric_piece)`

5. **CutPossible(tool, material):** States that a cut can be successfully made with the given tool on the specified material, considering both compatibility and tool condition.
   - Example: `CutPossible(scalpel, skin)`

6. **Dull(tool):** Represents the condition where a tool is dull and requires sharpening.
   - Example: `Dull(cheese_knife)`

### Logical Statements

1. **Represent Error Conditions:**
   These logical statements use the predicates to capture common error conditions:

   - **Blunt Tool:** If a tool is blunt, an error condition arises.
     - `Error(tool) :- Blunt(tool).`

   - **Incompatible Material:** If a tool is not compatible with the material, cutting is error-prone.
     - `Error(tool, material) :- ¬MaterialCompatible(tool, material).`

   - **Non-operational Tool:** Tools that are not operational will result in errors.
     - `Error(tool) :- ¬ToolOperational(tool).`

2. **Represent Success Conditions:**
   These logical representations encapsulate common success states:

   - **Clean Cut:** A clean cut is achieved only if the tool is operational and material compatible.
     - `Success(object) :- CleanCut(object), ToolOperational(tool), MaterialCompatible(tool, material).`

   - **Possible Cut:** A cut is possible if the tool is sharp enough and properly functional with respect to the material.
     - `CutPossible(tool, material) :- ToolOperational(tool), MaterialCompatible(tool, material), ¬Blunt(tool).`

### Example Usage

- To deduce that a clean cut can be achieved with a given tool:
  - If `ToolOperational(knife)` and `MaterialCompatible(knife, tomato)`, then a clean cut might be expected, so `Success(slice_tomato)` could be asserted if it's indeed achieved: `CleanCut(slice_tomato).`

Logical statements like these can help systematically determine whether a cutting task will succeed or encounter errors based on the condition and compatibility of tools and materials involved.
