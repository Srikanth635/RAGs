# Flanagan Action Model Applied to Cutting an Apple

The **Flanagan Action Model** describes actions in terms of motion phases, where each phase has specific **goals** and **parameters**. When applied to cutting an apple, this model allows for precise breakdowns of each phase, from positioning to cutting, and highlights the goals and parameters that ensure a successful cut. 

Cutting an apple typically involves several motion phases: positioning, initiating the cut, performing the cut, and completing the action. Each phase is guided by specific goals, parameters, and control adjustments to achieve clean, consistent slices or segments.

## Motion Phases in Cutting an Apple

### 1. **Positioning Phase**

   - **Goal**: Properly align the apple and cutting tool to ensure stability and accuracy during the cut.
   - **Parameters**:
     - **Apple Placement**: Ensure the apple is stable and does not roll, often by placing it flat on a cutting surface or by positioning it so that the stem is pointing up.
     - **Knife Alignment**: Align the knife at the intended starting point, typically above the apple’s centerline for halving or segmenting.
     - **Angle of Approach**: Position the knife at an initial angle that allows control and stability, usually around 90° if cutting vertically through the core.
   - **Key Actions**:
     - Adjust the apple and tool to achieve a stable orientation.
     - Fine-tune knife position to ensure the first cut is accurate.

### 2. **Initiation Phase**

   - **Goal**: Start the cut with enough pressure and precision to penetrate the apple’s skin and establish a controlled cutting path.
   - **Parameters**:
     - **Initial Force**: Apply moderate force to puncture the apple’s outer skin without causing slipping or excessive pressure that could lead to crushing.
     - **Angle Adjustment**: Maintain the knife angle to stay aligned with the intended cut path.
     - **Speed**: Use a slow, controlled motion to ensure the knife does not slip off the apple surface.
   - **Key Actions**:
     - Apply steady downward pressure to break the skin cleanly.
     - Begin slicing along the apple’s surface, maintaining alignment for consistency.

### 3. **Cutting Phase**

   - **Goal**: Execute the primary cutting motion through the apple with consistent force and speed, producing smooth slices or segments.
   - **Parameters**:
     - **Force**: Moderate, consistent pressure to slice through both the firm outer skin and softer interior without crushing the apple.
     - **Cutting Speed**: Maintain a steady speed to avoid tearing or creating uneven slices.
     - **Blade Angle Control**: Adjust the angle as needed to follow the shape of the apple, particularly around curved surfaces.
   - **Key Actions**:
     - Execute a downward slicing motion with even force.
     - Adjust the angle gradually as the knife moves through different layers of the apple.
     - Ensure the knife maintains a steady path through the apple’s core for even slicing.

### 4. **Completion Phase**

   - **Goal**: Finish the cut smoothly, ensuring the apple is fully separated while minimizing jagged edges or unintentional splits.
   - **Parameters**:
     - **Reduced Force**: As the knife nears the bottom of the apple, reduce pressure to prevent damaging the final slice or creating a rough edge.
     - **Angle Stabilization**: Keep the blade straight to maintain a clean, complete separation.
     - **Cutting Speed**: Slightly reduce speed as the cut completes to control the final separation point.
   - **Key Actions**:
     - Ease off on pressure as the knife exits the apple.
     - Use a controlled motion to finish the cut cleanly.
     - Stabilize the apple to prevent accidental slipping or unwanted cuts in the final moments.

| **Cutting**       | Execute smooth slicing motion                | Consistent force, steady cutting speed, angle control                                            |
| **Completion**    | Finish cut cleanly, avoid jagged edges       | Reduced force, angle stabilization, controlled final speed                                       |

Each phase is essential for achieving a smooth, precise cut. By setting specific goals and adjusting parameters, the Flanagan Action Model provides a structured approach to cutting an apple, helping ensure quality results through controlled motion and real-time adjustments.
