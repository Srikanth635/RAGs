**Query:** What are the axioms defining common failures in manipulation tasks like spilling during pouring or inadequate grip during lifting, and what are the logical rules for detecting and recovering from these failures?In robotic manipulation tasks, modeling the axioms and logical rules to identify and recover from common failure modes, such as spilling during pouring or inadequate grip during lifting, involves understanding both the task and potential error conditions. Below, I outline some axioms and logical rules that could be used to detect and mitigate these failures:

### Common Failure Modes Axioms

1. **Spilling During Pouring (S_p):**  
   - Axiom: Spilling occurs if the angle of tilt exceeds the safe threshold or if the liquid's viscosity and container speed are improperly matched.
   - Detection Rule: \( \theta > \theta_{max} \land \text{OR} \; \text{container\_speed} \times \text{liquid\_viscosity} < \text{safe\_flow\_rate} \).
   - Recovery Strategy: Adjust the tilt angle \(\theta\) to \( \theta_{optimal} \) and slow down the pouring to match the safe flow rate.

2. **Inadequate Grip During Lifting (G_i):**  
   - Axiom: An inadequate grip is detected if the grip force is lower than the required threshold for the object's weight and surface friction.
   - Detection Rule: \( \text{grip\_force} < \text{required\_force}(\text{weight}, \text{friction}) \).
   - Recovery Strategy: Increase grip force to \( \text{required\_force}(\text{weight}, \text{friction}) \) or reposition grippers for better contact and increased normal force.

### Logical Rules for Detection and Recovery

To address these failure modes systematically, one can implement the following logical sequences in an AI or control system:

1. **Spilling During Pouring**

   - **Detection**:
     - Monitor the sensor data continuously to estimate tilt angle (\(\theta\)) and compare against \(\theta_{max}\).
     - Observe flow rate sensors to ensure it matches the appropriate safe flow range given the liquid type.

   - **Recovery**:
     - If detected: Invoke correction subroutine that adjusts the actuator controlling tilt.
     - Incorporate visual or weight sensors to provide feedback, allowing dynamic real-time adjustments.

2. **Inadequate Grip During Lifting**

   - **Detection**:
     - Continuously measure grip force through tactile sensors.
     - Use data fusion from weight sensors to confirm the object's characteristics and match them with grip requirements.

   - **Recovery**:
     - If detected: Trigger a feedback loop to increase actuator power or reposition the gripper.
     - Use proximity sensors to ascertain the starting location and resettle the object before retrying the lift.

### General Guidelines for Rule Implementation

1. **Sensor Calibration and Feedback Loops**:
   - Ensure that sensors are well-calibrated to detect deviations from normal operating conditions.
   - Implement feedback loops for real-time correction once a failure mode is detected.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Use predictive models that can anticipate failure modes by learning from past task executions and adjusting plans preemptively.

3. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Structure software routines to handle exceptions, with clear responses for identified failure modes, to prevent cascading failures.
   
By incorporating these axioms and logical rules, robotic systems can improve their robustness and autonomy when handling typical manipulation tasks, minimizing risk and maintaining operational efficacy.
