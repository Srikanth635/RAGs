**Summary:**
Design a robot system to slice a mango into two pieces, including identifying FrameNet action cores and corresponding robot actions.Designing a robotic system to perform the task "slice the mango into two pieces" involves breaking down the task into a series of structured actions that a robot can understand and execute. We will use FrameNet action cores to identify these components and pair them with corresponding robot actions.

### FrameNet Action Cores

FrameNet provides a way to describe actions through "frames," which include various core components:

1. **Agent**: The entity that performs the action.
2. **Patient/Entity**: The object that is acted upon.
3. **Instrument**: The tool or means by which the action is performed.
4. **Goal**: The intended result of the action.
5. **Place**: The location where the action occurs.

### Corresponding Robot Actions

To translate the task into executable actions for a robotic system, consider each FrameNet component:

1. **Agent (Robot Arm)**
   - **Role**: Acts as the primary executor of the task.
   - **Action**: Initiates and controls all operations necessary for slicing the mango.

2. **Patient/Entity (Mango)**
   - **Role**: The object to be sliced.
   - **Action**: Needs to be correctly positioned and held steady for slicing.

3. **Instrument (Knife or Cutting Tool)**
   - **Role**: The tool used to perform the slicing.
   - **Action**: Controlled and manipulated by the robot arm to cut through the mango.

4. **Goal (Two Mango Halves)**
   - **Role**: The desired outcome of the task.
   - **Action**: Ensure the mango is divided evenly into two pieces.

5. **Place (Cutting Board or Work Surface)**
   - **Role**: The location where the slicing occurs.
   - **Action**: Provides a stable and clean base for performing the task.

### Robot Actions Sequence

1. **Positioning Step**:
   - Detect and acquire the position of the mango using sensors (e.g., vision system).
   - Move the mango to a stable position on a cutting board using a robotic gripper.

2. **Stabilizing Step**:
   - Secure the mango using a secondary gripping mechanism or suction to prevent movement during slicing.

3. **Cutting Preparation**:
   - Ensure the knife or cutting tool is securely attached to the robot arm.
   - Calibrate the cutting tool's position and angle relative to the mango.

4. **Slicing Action**:
   - Carefully lower and apply pressure with the cutting tool through the mango.
   - Follow a straight path through the mango to ensure even slicing.

5. **Completion and Verification**:
   - Lift the cutting tool after slicing.
   - Use sensors to verify the mango is evenly sliced into two halves before proceeding to remove.

By breaking down the task using FrameNet action cores and aligning each with specific robot actions, we create a detailed, step-by-step robotic system capable of executing the task of slicing a mango into two pieces. The system must incorporate sensors for feedback, precision control for manipulation, and safety mechanisms to handle the task efficiently and reliably.
