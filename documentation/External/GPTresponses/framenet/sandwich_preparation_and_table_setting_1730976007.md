**Query:**
Give examples of scenarios where multiple FrameNet action cores are used either one after another or at the same time, such as making a sandwich or setting up a table. Detail each scenario by breaking it down into action cores and frame elements, and describe how each action core is crucial for completing the task.

Certainly! FrameNet is a lexical database that captures the meanings of words by putting them into frames, which describe types of events, relations, or entities, and include frame elements that specify the participants and props involved. Let's look at two real-world scenarios: making a sandwich and setting a table. I'll break down each task into associated FrameNet action cores and frame elements.

### Scenario 1: Preparing a Sandwich

**Action Core 1: Grabbing Ingredients**  
- **Frame:** Getting
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Agent:** The person making the sandwich.
    - **Theme:** Ingredients such as bread, cheese, lettuce, tomato, etc.
- **Contribution:** This initial step sets up the preparatory stage by securing necessary resources, making it possible to proceed with sandwich assembly.

**Action Core 2: Assembling the Sandwich**
- **Frame:** Applying_heat
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Cook:** The person making the sandwich.
    - **Entity:** The sandwich components.
    - **Heat_source:** Heated griddle or toaster (if applicable).
- **Frame:** Placing
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Agent:** The person placing ingredients.
    - **Theme:** Components like ham, lettuce, etc.
    - **Goal:** The final sandwich form.
- **Contribution:** These actions are crucial for the structure of the sandwich, arranging each layer to achieve the desired taste and physics.

**Action Core 3: Finalizing the Sandwich**
- **Frame:** Cutting
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Agent:** The person cutting the sandwich.
    - **Instrument:** Knife.
    - **Theme:** The completed sandwich.
- **Contribution:** This step improves manageability and presentation, enhancing user experience by turning the bulky sandwich into shareable or bite-sized portions.

### Scenario 2: Setting a Table

**Action Core 1: Cleaning the Surface**
- **Frame:** Cleaning
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Agent:** Person setting the table.
    - **Theme:** Table surface.
    - **Means:** Cloth, cleaning agent.
- **Contribution:** Provides a clean starting area, ensuring hygiene and readiness for setting cutlery and dishes.

**Action Core 2: Arranging Tableware**
- **Frame:** Arranging
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Arranger:** Person setting the table.
    - **Theme:** Plates, forks, knives, glasses.
    - **Goal:** Predefined positions.
- **Contribution:** This step defines the tableâ€™s layout, allowing for easy reach and use of items by diners, following social and aesthetic norms.

**Action Core 3: Adding Decorative Elements**
- **Frame:** Decorating
  - **Core Elements:**
    - **Decorator:** Person adding decorations.
    - **Theme:** Flowers, candles, napkins.
    - **Location:** Table.
- **Contribution:** Enhances visual appeal and ambience, creating a welcoming, pleasant environment for dining.

In both scenarios, each frame contributes distinctly to achieve the task's completion, with action cores dependent on systematic execution to ensure success. These frames can be overlapping or interdependent, demonstrating how several elements work together intricately in real-world applications.
