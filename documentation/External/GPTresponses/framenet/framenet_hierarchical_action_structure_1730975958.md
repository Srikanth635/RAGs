### Query Summary:
**How can FrameNet action cores be organized hierarchically from broad categories to specific actions for complex manipulation tasks, and how does this benefit task planning?**Organizing FrameNet action cores hierarchically for complex manipulation tasks can be advantageous for various applications, particularly in robotics, AI task planning, and linguistic processing. The hierarchical structure enables more efficient task parsing, logical task planning, improved human-computer interaction, and semantic understanding. Here's how frame action cores could be organized:

### Benefits of this Organization for Task Planning:

1. **Scalability**: A hierarchical model accommodates changes and expansions in task complexity. New actions and sub-actions can be added under appropriate categories without overhauling the entire system.

2. **Efficiency**: Streamlines task planning by providing a clear roadmap from broad categories down to specific actions, aiding in the automation and programming of complex tasks.

3. **Modularity**: Each level of the hierarchy can be independently developed or optimized, allowing more straightforward updates or integration with new technologies.

4. **Clarity and Consistency**: Establishes roles and expectations for human workers or machines by breaking tasks into intuitive steps, thereby minimizing misinterpretation.

5. **Reusability**: Common actions across tasks can be re-used, improving the efficiency of manual or automated planning processes.

6. **Enhanced Modeling**: Facilitates improved linguistic and semantic understanding, critical for natural language processing applications where understanding human task instructions is required.

This hierarchical approach not only mirrors the logical progression of tasks in real-world settings but also enhances both human and machine understanding of complex manipulation tasks. By applying this structure, practitioners can build systems that are more adaptive, intuitive, and aligned with practical task execution needs.
