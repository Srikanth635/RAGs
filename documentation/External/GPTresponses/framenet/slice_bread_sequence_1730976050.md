**Summarized Query:**
Generate a sequence of FrameNet action cores suitable for 'slicing bread', considering object properties and environmental constraints.To achieve the goal of "slice the bread," we can identify a sequence of FrameNet action cores that account for object properties (such as the type of bread) and environmental constraints (like tools available). Here's a structured approach:

1. **Retrieve_a_tool**  
   - **Core Elements**: 
     - Agent: Person intending to slice the bread.
     - Tool: Knife suitable for slicing bread (serrated knife, chefâ€™s knife).
   - **Associated Frame Elements**: Location (kitchen, drawer), Manner (carefully).

2. **Position_object**  
   - **Core Elements**: 
     - Agent: Person.
     - Object: Bread to be sliced.
     - Ground: Cutting board or any stable surface.
   - **Associated Frame Elements**: Location (countertop), Manner (firmly).

3. **Manipulate_object**  
   - **Core Elements**: 
     - Agent: Person.
     - Object: Bread.
     - Tool: Knife.
   - **Associated Frame Elements**: Holding bread steady with one hand.

4. **Cut**  
   - **Core Elements**: 
     - Agent: Person.
     - Object: Bread.
     - Tool: Knife, acting as an implement to perform the cutting action.
   - **Associated Frame Elements**: 
     - Duration (short), Iteration (repeated slicing movements), Manner (sawing motion if using a serrated knife).

5. **Separate_parts**  
   - **Core Elements**: 
     - Agent: Person.
     - Whole: Bread.
     - Parts: Sliced pieces.
   - **Associated Frame Elements**: Desired thickness of slices.

6. **Assess_result**  
   - **Core Elements**: 
     - Agent: Person.
     - Created_structure: Sliced bread.
   - **Associated Frame Elements**: Satisfaction with slice uniformity, size.

Additional considerations might include factors such as:
- Bread type (e.g., soft bread may require a gentler touch, whereas crusty bread may need more force).
- Environmental concerns (availability of cutting board space, potential for crumbs).

This sequence considers the necessary steps and variations based on available tools and desired slicing outcome.
