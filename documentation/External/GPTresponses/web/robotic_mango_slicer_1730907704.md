**Summary:** Design a robot to slice a mango into two and link FrameNet action cores to robot actions.To design a robotic system that can perfectly perform the task of slicing a mango into two pieces, we will focus on breaking down the task into detailed steps. We'll use FrameNet to identify relevant action cores. FrameNet is a linguistic resource that documents the range of semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities of each word in each of its senses. For this task, we can identify essential actions like "Grasp", "Position", "Align", "Slice", and "Release".

### System Design Overview

#### 1. **Mechanical Components**
   - **Gripper**: To hold and manipulate the mango.
   - **Knife**: A sharp blade specifically designed for cutting soft fruit.
   - **Sensors**: For detecting the orientation and properties (like the position of the seed) of the mango.
   - **Robot Arm**: Flexible and precise movement to carry out the slicing procedure.

#### 2. **Control System**
   - **Vision System**: To recognize the mango and assess its size, orientation, and ripeness.
   - **Motion Control**: To execute precise movements based on sensory input.
   - **Processor**: To interpret sensory data, control robotic actions, and ensure safety and efficiency.

#### 3. **Software Components**
   - **Image Processing Module**: To analyze imagery data from visual sensors and guide the robot in identifying the mango and determining the appropriate cutting line.
   - **Task Execution Module**: To convert processed data into motor commands that control the robotâ€™s movements.
   - **Safety and Error Handling Module**: To address potential issues like unexpected object movement, equipment failure, or suboptimal cuts.

### Task Breakdown Using FrameNet Action Cores

#### **Step 1: Grasp**
- **FrameNet Core**: `Manipulation`
- **Robot Action**: The gripper approaches and securely grasps the mango without applying excessive pressure. Sensors help adjust the gripper's force to avoid bruising the fruit.

#### **Step 2: Position**
- **FrameNet Core**: `Placing`
- **Robot Action**: The robot arm moves the mango into an optimal position for slicing, likely held upright along its longer symmetry axis just above the cutting surface.

#### **Step 3: Align**
- **FrameNet Core**: `Adjustment`
- **Robot Action**: Adjust the alignment of the knife relative to the mango's center line, ensuring the knife will accurately slice the mango into two equal halves.

#### **Step 4: Slice**
- **FrameNet Core**: `Cutting`
- **Robot Action**: Slow and controlled downward motion of the blade along the predetermined path. The knife should be sharp and its motion smooth to ensure a clean cut through the fruit and around the seed.

#### **Step 5: Release**
- **FrameNet Core**: `Releasing`
- **Robot Action**: After the slicing action, the gripper releases the mango segments, possibly transferring them to another area for further processing or packaging.

### Integration and Testing
- **Integration**: After assembling the mechanical and control systems, integrate with the software components. Ensure all parts communicate seamlessly.
- **Testing**: Start with simple tests focusing on each action and gradually move to full task simulations. Adjust parameters like grip strength, knife speed, and alignment based on initial outcomes.

### Safety Precautions and Final Considerations
- **Safety**: Ensure the system has emergency shutdown capabilities. Regular maintenance for mechanical parts and timely updates for software parts are vital.
- **Optimization**: Reiterate design and testing to deal with mangoes of different sizes and ripeness for improved adaptability.

By following this breakdown and integrating with proper FrameNet action cores, the designed robotic system should effectively and efficiently slice a mango into two pieces.
