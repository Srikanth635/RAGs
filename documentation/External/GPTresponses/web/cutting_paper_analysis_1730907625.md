**Summarized Query:**
Analyze and compare the key FrameNet action cores in the task of 'cutting paper with scissors' between humans and robots.Analyzing human and robotic performances of a task such as cutting a piece of paper with scissors involves understanding the basic action steps and the cognitive and physical requirements of each step. In FrameNet, a computational linguistics tool that categorizes English words based on their meanings and the contexts in which they arise, several action cores can be identified for this process. Let's break down the task and compare human and robot performances based on these frames:

### Human Demonstration of Cutting Paper with Scissors
1. **Manipulation**: This involves the overall action of handling scissors.
   - **Sub-Action Cores**:
     - _Grasping_: Holding the scissors by the handles.
     - _Positioning_: Aligning the scissors with the starting point on the paper.
2. **Using instrument**: Utilizing scissors to perform a cutting action.
   - _Sub-Action Cores_:
     - _Application of force_: Applying pressure to close the scissors' blades.
     - _Guidance_: Directing the path of the scissors to follow the desired line or pattern.
3. **Motion**: Movement of the scissors through the paper.
   - _Sub-Action Cores_:
     - _Continuous motion_: Smooth progression of blades through paper.
     - _Directional change_: Adjusting direction as needed per the cut's required shape or design.
4. **Perception**: Visual monitoring of the cutting process.
   - _Sub-Action Cores_:
     - _Observing_: Watching the scissor blades meet the marked lines on the paper.
     - _Adjusting_: Modifying angle or pressure in response to visual feedback.

### Robot Performance of the Same Task
Robots perform the same task based on programmed instructions and sensor feedback.

1. **Manipulation**:
   - Robots use mechanical grippers designed to mimic human grasping and positioning abilities, generally programmed to execute predefined movements.
2. **Using instrument**:
   - The robot applies a uniform force as instructed by its programming, which can be adjusted by sensors that detect resistance.
   - Guidance systems in robots often use precise motion paths plotted in advance and corrected in real-time via feedback mechanisms from visual or tactile sensors.
3. **Motion**:
   - Robotic movement can be more precise and consistent, benefiting from linear actuators and servo motors that maintain an even speed and pressure.
4. **Perception**: 
   - Robots rely on sensors and computer vision systems to monitor the path of the cut. These systems evaluate positional data and make corrections, often surpassing human precision but lacking adaptive intuition.

### Comparison
- **Precision and Consistency**: Robots often excel in precision and consistency compared to humans due to the exact replication of programmed instructions and less variability in movement.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Humans naturally adjust their techniques based on sensory feedback and experience, which can be an advantage in tasks requiring real-time adaptation.
- **Complexity and Variation Handling**: While humans can easily adjust to changes in material texture or unexpected obstacles, robots may require additional programming and sensor input to handle such variations effectively.

Understanding these FrameNet action cores and their implementation in humans and robots provides a structured way to evaluate and enhance robotic systems for tasks traditionally performed by humans.
