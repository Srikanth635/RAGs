**Query:** Sequence of FrameNet action cores for the goal 'slice the bread', considering object properties and environmental constraints.To achieve the goal of slicing bread, we must consider a sequence of actions that are suitable within the context of both the object properties (such as the type of bread and its condition) and environmental constraints (such as the availability of tools and space). Using FrameNet frames which classify scenarios into conceptual schemas, we can generate a detailed action plan. Here is a plausible sequence of FrameNet action cores:

1. **Preparing**:
   - *Purposeful_action* - Deciding to slice the bread either for making sandwiches, serving with a meal, etc.
   - *Self_motion* - Moving towards the location of the bread and the cutting tools (like moving to the kitchen).

2. **Inspecting**:
   - *Inspection* - Checking the type of bread (soft, hard crust, fresh, stale) to determine the best method and tools for slicing.
   - *Experiencer_obj* - Feeling the texture of the bread if needed, to assess its condition.

3. **Arranging**:
   - *Arranging* - Placing the bread on a suitable cutting surface, such as a cutting board.
   - *Choosing* - Selecting an appropriate knife (bread knife, serrated knife).

4. **Handling**:
   - *Manipulation* - Gripping the knife properly.
   - *Using* (instrumentally) - Holding and stabilizing the bread with one hand to keep it in place while slicing.

5. **Cutting**:
   - *Cause_motion* - Applying the knife to the bread using downward and sawing motions.
   - *Contacting* - Ensuring the knife blade makes contact with the bread in the desired places for even slices.

6. **Assessing**:
   - *Judgment_communication* - Observing the slices to ensure they are of consistent thickness and quality.
   - *Measurement* - Optionally measuring the slices for specific widths (useful in a professional setting or for special requirements).

7. **Adjusting**:
   - *Revision* - Making necessary adjustments to technique or knife position if slices are not satisfactory.
   
8. **Completing**:
   - *Achieving* - Completing the slicing process until all desired slices are made.
   - *Existence* (resultative) - Ensuring that the sliced bread now exists in the form suited for its intended use.

This sequence provides a comprehensive action plan covering decision-making, preparation, execution, and evaluation. Each step is crucial for efficiently achieving the goal of 'slice the bread' while addressing both the physical properties of the bread and the situational environment.
