## FrameNet Action Cores for Everyday Manipulation Tasks

In FrameNet, **action cores** represent the fundamental actions associated with specific frames, typically involving participants like the **Agent** (the entity performing the action) and the **Patient** (the entity affected by the action). Everyday manipulation tasks involve actions where an agent interacts with an object to achieve a goal, making these frames essential for modeling tasks like picking up, pushing, cutting, and assembling objects.

Below are some FrameNet action cores related to common manipulation tasks:

---

### 1. **Grasping**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent taking hold of an object with a hand or tool.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity grasping the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being grasped.
   - **Example**: "The worker *grabbed* the handle to pull the cart."

---

### 2. **Placing**
   - **Description**: Represents an action where an agent moves an object to a specified location.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity placing the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being placed.
     - **Goal**: The location where the object is placed.
   - **Example**: "She *placed* the book on the shelf."

---

### 3. **Inserting**
   - **Description**: An action where an agent puts an object inside another object or space.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity inserting the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being inserted.
     - **Goal**: The container or space where the object is inserted.
   - **Example**: "He *inserted* the key into the lock."

---

### 4. **Removing**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent taking an object out of a container or space.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity removing the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being removed.
     - **Source**: The location from which the object is removed.
   - **Example**: "She *removed* the paper from the printer."

---

### 5. **Cutting**
   - **Description**: An agent uses a sharp tool to divide an object into parts.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity performing the cutting.
     - **Theme**: The object being cut.
     - **Instrument**: The tool used to cut the object.
   - **Example**: "He *sliced* the bread with a knife."

---

### 6. **Pushing**
   - **Description**: Represents an action where an agent applies force to move an object in a particular direction.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity pushing the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being pushed.
     - **Goal**: The direction or target location.
   - **Example**: "She *pushed* the cart toward the exit."

---

### 7. **Pulling**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent applying force to draw an object closer or move it in a specified direction.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity pulling the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being pulled.
     - **Goal**: The direction or target location.
   - **Example**: "He *pulled* the rope to lift the bucket."

---

### 8. **Rotating**
   - **Description**: An agent applies force to turn or twist an object around an axis.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity rotating the object.
     - **Theme**: The object being rotated.
     - **Axis**: The axis around which the object rotates.
   - **Example**: "She *twisted* the cap to open the bottle."

---

### 9. **Pouring**
   - **Description**: An agent transfers a substance from one container to another by tilting or spilling.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity pouring the substance.
     - **Theme**: The substance being poured.
     - **Source**: The container the substance is poured from.
     - **Goal**: The container or location where the substance is poured.
   - **Example**: "He *poured* the water into the glass."

---

### 10. **Assembling**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent combining components to form a whole or new structure.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity assembling.
     - **Components**: The parts being combined.
     - **Goal**: The assembled object or structure.
   - **Example**: "She *assembled* the furniture pieces."

---

### Summary

These action cores represent essential components for understanding manipulation tasks in everyday contexts. Each frame defines the fundamental roles and participants involved, allowing systems to model and interpret actions like grasping, placing, cutting, and assembling. In robotics and AI, these action cores are invaluable for developing systems capable of interpreting and performing complex manipulation tasks.
