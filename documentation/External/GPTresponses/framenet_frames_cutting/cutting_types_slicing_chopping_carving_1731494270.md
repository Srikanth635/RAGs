**What specific sub-frames or related frames detail types of cutting, such as slicing, chopping, and carving?**In the context of frame semantics, "cutting" can be represented by a frame that encompasses different types of actions and instruments involved in dividing or incising materials. The FrameNet project, which captures frames of meaning in the English language, includes various frames related to the concept of cutting. Here's a brief overview of some relevant sub-frames or related frames that describe specific types of cutting:

1. **Cutting Frame**: This is the general frame that involves a scenario where an agent uses a cutting instrument to separate a material object or reduce it in size.

2. **Slicing Frame**: A sub-frame of cutting where an object is cut into relatively thin, broad pieces. This typically involves a motion parallel to the surface being cut.

3. **Chopping Frame**: This sub-frame describes cutting that involves making quick, forceful motions, often resulting in smaller pieces. This is common in culinary contexts.

4. **Carving Frame**: Involves the removal of material, shaping it in the process. This could apply to both artistic and functional contexts, such as carving wood or carving a roast.

5. **Dicing Frame**: A type of cutting where the objective is to produce small, cube-shaped pieces, often used culinarily.

These frames help delineate the nuanced ways in which cutting actions can be performed and described, reflecting different instruments, motions, contexts, and objectives associated with each type of cutting.
