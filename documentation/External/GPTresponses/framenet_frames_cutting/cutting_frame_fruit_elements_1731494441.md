4. **Fruit**: The fruits that are to be prepared, washed, and ready for cutting.

5. **Towel**: To keep hands and cutting surfaces dry, preventing slippage and ensuring safety.

6. **Guidelines for Cuts**: Knowing the specific cuts needed, such as slices, cubes, or wedges, depending on the recipe requirement.

   - **Peeler**: If the fruit requires peeling.
   - **Melon Baller**: For creating consistent spheres from fruits like melons or apples.
   - **Coring Tool**: Useful for removing cores from apples, pears, etc.
