What frames are associated with cutting in terms of changing object shapes?In the context of altering the shape of objects, "Cutting" is closely related to several frames and concepts. Here are a few:

1. **Shaping**: This is a broader frame that encompasses various methods of altering the shape of objects, including cutting, carving, molding, and sculpting.

2. **Segmentation**: This involves dividing an object into parts, which often involves cutting as a primary method.

3. **Trimming**: This specifically refers to removing excess material from an object to achieve a desired shape or size. Cutting tools are typically used in this process.

4. **Carving**: While cutting is a component of this activity, carving involves shaping materials like wood, stone, or ice through detailed cutting and chiseling.

5. **Slicing**: This term is often used in contexts like food preparation, where objects are cut into pieces or layers.

6. **Machining**: In industrial contexts, this frame encompasses various cutting methods such as milling, turning, and drilling to alter the shape of materials, usually metals.

7. **Laceration**: While typically used in a medical context, this frame refers to the act of cutting or tearing tissue in the body.

8. **Pruning**: In gardening and agriculture, this involves cutting away dead or overgrown branches or stems to encourage healthy growth.

Each of these frames involves some aspect of cutting but is distinguished by the specific context or tool used, the material being shaped, or the intended outcome of the action.
