- **Affordance Theory**: Originating from psychology, this framework suggests objects have inherent properties that suggest their uses, influencing how agents, including robots, perceive and interact with their environment.

- **Embodied Cognition**: A cognitive science framework emphasizing that cognition arises from having a body that interacts with the world, crucial in understanding how agents perform physical manipulation.

- **Bayesian Inference Models**: Used in AI, these models apply probabilistic reasoning to predict outcomes of interactions and decision-making, useful in uncertain environments.

- **Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs)**: In robotics and AI, HTNs decompose complex tasks into simpler, manageable actions, aiding in planning and execution of sequential interactions.

- **Motor Control Theory**: Explores how the nervous system executes precise movements, often employed in robotics to replicate human-like manipulation skills.

- **Causal Reasoning Frameworks**: These frameworks are used to understand and predict the effects of actions in AI and psychology, deducing cause-effect relationships in physical interactions.

- **Ecological Psychology Models**: Focus on understanding perception and action as a dynamic interaction between the organism and its environment, applicable in robotics for adaptive interactions.

- **Skill-based Robotics Frameworks**: Involves learning and executing physical manipulation actions by observing and mimicking skilled human actions, often using machine learning techniques.

- **Symbolic AI Approaches**: Employ logic-based representations to manage knowledge and decision-making processes for manipulation tasks.

These frameworks are instrumental across fields for understanding and designing systems that can effectively engage in physical manipulation and interactions.Understanding everyday physical interactions and manipulation actions is a multidisciplinary area of study involving AI, robotics, psychology, and cognitive science. Here are some established conceptual frameworks and models that are often used in these fields:

1. **Affordance Theory**:
   - Originating from psychology and coined by James Gibson, affordance theory refers to the actionable possibilities available in an environment, determined by the relationship between an agent (animal, human, or robot) and its environment. In AI and robotics, affordances are used to help machines understand how objects can be interacted with.

2. **Schema Theory**:
   - In cognitive science, a schema is a structured framework or plan for understanding concepts, events, and actions. In robotics and AI, schemas are leveraged to design algorithms that allow machines to recognize and perform tasks by drawing on generalized prior knowledge.

3. **Motor Control and Coordination Theories**:
   - Theories such as Bernstein's theory of coordinating movements (also known as the Degrees of Freedom Problem) and Schmidt's Schema Theory explain how humans plan and execute movements. In robotics, these theories help design control systems that mimic human motor skills and adaptation.

4. **Task-oriented Grasping Frameworks**:
   - These frameworks guide robotic systems to plan and perform grasping actions based on the task requirements. They integrate factors like object shape, compliance, and purpose of the action (e.g., lifting, pushing). Examples include the Anticipatory Grasp Choice and Grasp Affordances methodologies.

5. **Action Recognition Models**:
   - Models like Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, and Convolutional Neural Networks are used for recognizing and predicting human actions from sequences of movements or sensor data, helping AI and robotics systems interact more seamlessly with humans.

6. **Dynamic Systems Theory (DST)**:
   - DST describes how complex systems change over time. It has been applied in cognitive science to model perception and action integration. In robotics, DST informs the creation of adaptive control systems that enable robots to respond to environmental changes in real-time.

7. **Probabilistic Robotics Frameworks**:
   - Approaches such as the Bayesian Network and Monte Carlo methods are used for dealing with uncertainty in sensor data and environment interaction. These frameworks support decision-making processes in adaptive and intelligent robotic systems.

8. **Ecological Psychology**:
   - Similar to affordances, this perspective emphasizes the study of perception-action systems in dynamic environments. It has influenced AI and robotics in developing systems that adapt to complex real-world scenarios without relying solely on preconceived models.

9. **Embodied Cognition**:
   - This framework suggests that cognition is deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world. In robotics and AI, the approach emphasizes creating systems with sensory and motor capabilities integrated with cognitive processes, enabling more natural interaction with the environment.

These frameworks provide foundational knowledge and methodologies that inform the design and development of intelligent systems capable of interpreting, predicting, and manipulating their physical surroundings.
