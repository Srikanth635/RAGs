**Core Principles of Common-Sense Physics:**

1. **Gravity**: Objects are naturally pulled towards the earth, causing them to fall when unsupported. This principle guides how objects interact with surfaces above or below them.

2. **Inertia**: Objects in motion stay in motion, and objects at rest remain at rest, unless acted upon by an external force. This explains resistance to changes in motion.

3. **Friction**: The resistance that one surface encounters when moving over another. It enables controlled movement and prevents slipping.

4. **Solidity**: Solid objects cannot pass through each other, maintaining their distinct boundaries and shapes. This affects how objects interact when colliding or placed together.

These principles help understand and predict how objects behave and are essential for realistic action models in everyday contexts.In developing action models for everyday manipulation tasks, embedding the principles of common-sense physics is crucial. These principles help a system understand and predict how objects will behave in the real world. Here are the core principles with intuitive explanations:

1. **Gravity**:  
   - **Principle**: Objects are attracted toward the earth, which gives them weight and causes them to fall when unsupported.
   - **Intuitive Explanation**: Imagine holding an apple. If you let go, it will drop to the ground because gravity pulls it down. This helps models predict that unsupported objects will fall.

2. **Inertia**:  
   - **Principle**: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.
   - **Intuitive Explanation**: A rolling ball on a smooth surface continues to roll until friction or another force slows it down. This principle assists models in anticipating that objects will maintain their current state unless influenced by an external force.

3. **Friction**:  
   - **Principle**: Friction is a force that opposes the motion of objects or surfaces sliding or rolling over each other.
   - **Intuitive Explanation**: Pushing a book across a table requires force due to friction between the book and the table. Understanding friction helps models determine how much force is needed to move or stop an object.

4. **Solidity**:  
   - **Principle**: Solid objects are not supposed to pass through each other; they occupy exclusive space.
   - **Intuitive Explanation**: When you place a cup on a table, it doesn’t sink through because both are solid. This principle is fundamental for models to predict that objects will not interpenetrate or overlap in space.

5. **Support**:  
   - **Principle**: Objects need support to remain stationary against gravity; without it, they will fall.
   - **Intuitive Explanation**: A book stays on a shelf due to the shelf’s support; remove the book's support, and it falls. Models can utilize this to understand the necessity of support to maintain object stability.

6. **Contact and Force Transmission**:  
   - **Principle**: Force transmitted through physical contact changes an object's motion or direction.
   - **Intuitive Explanation**: If you push a toy car, it accelerates forward due to the force of the push. Models use this idea to simulate how interactions affect object behavior.

Incorporating these principles, action models can make more reliable and human-like predictions about object dynamics, manipulation tasks, and interactions with the physical world. Understanding these concepts allows artificial intelligence and robotics systems to operate effectively in everyday environments.
