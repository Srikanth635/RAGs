**Core Principles and Theories Behind Common Sense, Intuitive Physics, and Action Knowledge:**

1. **Common Sense Reasoning:**
   - *Naive Physics:* Suggests that humans possess an innate understanding of the physical world, allowing them to make intuitive judgments about object properties and interactions.
   - *Heuristics and Biases:* Cognitive shortcuts that simplify decision-making, often based on experience or instinct.

2. **Intuitive Physics:**
   - *Mental Simulation Theory:* Proposes that people simulate the physical world in their minds to predict outcomes of physical interactions.
   - *Core Knowledge Theory:* Suggests that intuitive physics is part of a set of innate knowledge systems evolved to help humans navigate their environments.

3. **Action Knowledge:**
   - *Motor Schema Theory:* Explains how motor actions are organized into patterns that can be adapted to achieve specific tasks.
   - *Affordance Theory (Gibson):* States that objects offer "affordances"—possibilities for action that are perceived directly by a user, shaping their interaction with the environment.

4. **Cognitive and Perceptual Theories Relevant to Manipulation Actions:**
   - *Embodied Cognition:* Emphasizes that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world, influencing action planning.
   - *Dynamical Systems Theory:* Views movement behavior as emerging from complex interactions between brain, body, and environment.
   - *Ecological Psychology:* Focuses on how perception is directly linked to action without requiring detailed internal models, emphasizing direct perception-action coupling.

These theories collectively help in understanding how humans naturally perceive, predict, and interact with the physical world and its objects.Understanding common sense, intuitive physics, and action knowledge involves multiple cognitive, perceptual, and motor theories. Here's an overview of the core principles and theories that are often referenced:

### Common Sense and Intuitive Physics

1. **Core Knowledge Theory**:
   - Proposed by Spelke and others, this theory suggests that humans have innate, domain-specific systems that provide a foundation for acquiring knowledge. These domains include physics, psychology, and biology.

2. **Naïve Physics**:
   - Coined by Hayes, it refers to the intuitive understanding people have about the physical properties of the world, such as gravity, motion, and object permanence, without formal physics training.

3. **Mental Models**:
   - Originating from mental model theory (Johnson-Laird), this concept involves using mental representations to simulate and predict real-world phenomena, allowing individuals to reason through problems involving physical interactions.

### Perceptual Theories

1. **Gestalt Principles**:
   - These principles describe how people perceive objects as part of a greater whole and involve organizing visual elements into groups or unified wholes based on patterns or configurations.

2. **Ecological Approach to Perception**:
   - Proposed by Gibson, this approach emphasizes direct perception from environmental cues, suggesting that perception and action are closely linked through affordances, which are action possibilities offered by objects.

### Cognitive and Motor Theories

1. **Dynamic Systems Theory**:
   - This theory models human movement and cognition as complex systems that evolve over time, emphasizing the role of non-linear interactions among components rather than fixed sequences.

2. **Schema Theory**:
   - Introduced by Schmidt, this theory suggests that movements are guided by generalized motor programs, or schemas, which are adaptable structures in response to varying environmental conditions.

3. **Action-Perception Loop**:
   - This concept emphasizes the continuous cycle where perception informs action, and action provides feedback to perception, enabling individuals to adapt and refine their movements.

### Cognitive Science Theories

1. **Theory of Mind**:
   - This theory concerns the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, aiding in predicting and understanding others' actions and intentions.

2. **Bayesian Inference**:
   - In cognitive science, Bayesian models describe how probabilistic reasoning can be used to infer and predict the state of the environment, integrating prior knowledge with sensory information.

3. **Embodied Cognition**:
   - This theory posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world, suggesting that thinking is influenced by aspects of an individual's physical capacity to interact with the environment.

### Applications to Manipulation Actions

Understanding and executing manipulation actions rely on integrating these cognitive, perceptual, and motor theories to form seamless interactions with the environment. For instance:

- **Affordances and Tool Use**: Knowing how perception aligns with action possibilities (affordances) allows individuals to use tools efficiently, essentially selecting actions based on the perceived properties of objects.
  
- **Predictive Models**: Employing internal models to predict the outcome of actions can enhance coordination and efficiency in complex motor tasks such as catching or throwing.

- **Learning and Adaptation**: Through skill acquisition, individuals refine their mental models and schemas, improving their proficiency in manipulation tasks and adapting to new tools and scenarios.

These theories collectively explain how humans interpret and interact with the physical world using common sense and form the basis for designing intelligent systems in robotics that emulate human-like understanding and interaction capabilities.
