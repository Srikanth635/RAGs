5. **CoppeliaSim (formerly V-REP)**
   - **Core Features**: CoppeliaSim is a robotics simulator with a rich set of features, including scriptable kinematics, dynamics, and an integrated development environment. It supports various physics engines, allowing users to choose based on their need for accuracy or speed.
   - **Applications in Everyday Tasks**: CoppeliaSim is used extensively for the simulation of complex tasks like cooking where multiple interactions (e.g., stirring, flipping) and different materials (e.g., liquids, solids) need to be handled simultaneously.

### Core Features for Handling Real-World Physics Constraints

Physics simulators handle real-world constraints through a variety of features. Here are some critical ones:

- **Collision Detection and Response**: Essential for realistic interactions between objects, collision detection helps in understanding when two objects interfere, and collision response ensures they react in a realistic manner.
- **Material Properties and Dynamics**: Simulators often allow customization of material properties like elasticity, density, and friction coefficients to closely mimic real-world materials' behavior.
- Simulation of Environment Conditions: Factors such as gravity, air resistance, and environmental influences such as wind or water can be simulated to provide realistic scenarios.
- **Kinematic and Dynamic Constraints**: These are used to ensure that movements and interactions adhere to physical laws, such as conservation laws (momentum and energy), thereby making the simulation representative of real-life physics.
- **Integration with AI and ML Models**: Advanced simulation tasks in robotics often incorporate AI models that predict the outcomes of actions, which are crucial in tasks like cutting or manipulating fragile objects.

Simulators are indispensable tools in areas ranging from industrial automation to virtual reality and game development, offering near-real-life experiences without the associated risks or costs of physical prototypes.
