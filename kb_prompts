P: define describe and explain pouring action in framenet conceptual framework

P: framenet action representation of cutting an apple

P: give predicate logic axiomatization of the expression cutting an apple

P: what is flanagan action model

P: what is flanagan action model used in cognitive psychology of human actions

P: describe conceptual framework underlying the flanagan action model

P: describe the action of cutting an apple in the conceptual framework of flanagan action model

P: what is force dynamic model of everyday manipulation actions such as cutting

P: propose a conceptual framework that describes and explains the interaction between forces, effects and intentions in action categories like cutting an apple

P: flanagan action model represents actions interms of motion phases which have goals and parameters, based on that describe the motion phases and their goals and parameters of cutting an apple

P: extract the template of motions that are characteristic for cutting actions

P: now we ar going into the framework of robotics where the software engineers use models from control theory in order to develop reliable control systems for robot cutting actions, describe and explain the action cutting an apple in framework used by control engineers

P: take instruction websites like wikihow that contain descriptions of how everyday manipulation actions con be carried successfully and report what could go wrong and what to focus on, describe conceptual framework that explicitly explains the conceptual framework like wikihow and apply that to an action like cutting an apple

P: what are models of action categories such as cutting , pouring, transporting objects that are used in different scientific and engineering disciplines including cognitive neuroscience, NLU and generation, robotics, artificial intelligence, pedagogics and many others

P: what is the purpose of these models and how could the robot profit from applying these models to improve its capability to perform everyday manipulation actions successfully and understand what its doing


P: i want to build a huge knowledge base on common sense intuitive physics understanding, domain knowledge, action knowledge, for this purpose i want to ask chat gpt about models and representations of models used for understanding, performing , evaluating everyday manipulation actions. i want to do that by asking chatGPT about what is conceptual framework underlying the respective action model what is the 	purpose of action model describing the structure of the action model and explaining how the action model is used and the your task is to propose a plan for carrying out this research activity and 		formulate the plan as sequence of highly effective prompts that return excellent results
