# Cutting

## Task
Cutting
## Tactile Feedback
- **Resistance**: Feedback on the resistance encountered while cutting through the material.
  - Examples: Feeling soft resistance when cutting bread, Strong resistance while cutting raw meat
- **Texture**: Perception of the surface texture of the object being cut.
  - Examples: Smoothness of a tomato skin, Roughness of bread crust
- **Grip Stability**: Feedback on the stability of the tool in the hand during cutting.
  - Examples: Knife handle slipping due to moisture, Firm grip on scissors handle
- **Cut Completion**: Sensation of the tool passing completely through the material.
  - Examples: Knife hitting the cutting board after slicing, Scissors closing completely on fabric
- **Object Stability**: Feedback on the stability of the object being held or positioned for cutting.
  - Examples: Apple rolling during slicing, Vegetable staying still on a flat surface
- **Tool Vibration**: Vibrations felt in the tool during cutting, indicating material properties or issues.
  - Examples: Vibration when cutting hard carrots, Smooth motion while slicing soft cheese
- **Force Applied**: The amount of pressure or force required to cut through the material.
  - Examples: Minimal force for slicing a banana, Significant force for cutting through a bone
- **Material Separation**: Tactile sensation of the material separating as it is being cut.
  - Examples: Peel separating from an orange, Bread splitting into slices
- **Tool Sharpness**: Tactile cues indicating if the cutting tool is sharp or dull.
  - Examples: Smooth slicing with a sharp knife, Dragging sensation with a dull blade
- **Edge Contact**: Feeling the tool's edge interacting with the surface or object.
  - Examples: Knife edge catching on a tough vegetable skin, Scissors smoothly cutting through paper
