Cutting
## Strategies For Sensory Noise Or Uncertainty
- **Improve Lighting Conditions**: Ensure the cutting area is well-lit to reduce visual noise and improve clarity.
- **Stabilize Objects**: Use tools like non-slip mats or clamps to minimize object movement caused by sensory uncertainty.
- **Use Visual Guides**: Draw or mark cutting lines to provide clear visual cues for precise cuts.
- **Enhance Grip on Tools**: Use tools with ergonomic or textured grips to reduce tactile uncertainty.
- **Utilize Force-Control Tools**: Use tools with built-in mechanisms to regulate force and improve precision.
- **Calibrate Pressure**: Start with light pressure and adjust based on resistance feedback.
- **Verify Object Stability**: Double-check that the object is securely positioned before starting the cut.
- **Pause and Reassess**: Stop the cutting task briefly to reduce uncertainty and verify progress.
- **Minimize Distractions**: Reduce environmental distractions like noise or clutter that can add to sensory uncertainty.
- **Use Multisensory Feedback**: Combine visual, tactile, and auditory feedback to confirm cutting progress.
