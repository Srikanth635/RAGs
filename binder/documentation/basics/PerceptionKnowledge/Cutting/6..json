      "strategy": "Verify Object Stability",
      "description": "Double-check that the object is securely positioned before starting the cut.",
      "example": "Hold the object firmly or use a fork to stabilize it."

    {
      "strategy": "Pause and Reassess",
      "description": "Stop the cutting task briefly to reduce uncertainty and verify progress.",
      "example": "Check the cut depth and adjust alignment before continuing."

      "strategy": "Minimize Distractions",
      "description": "Reduce environmental distractions like noise or clutter that can add to sensory uncertainty.",
      "example": "Keep the workspace organized and free from unnecessary items."

    {
      "strategy": "Use Multisensory Feedback",
      "description": "Combine visual, tactile, and auditory feedback to confirm cutting progress.",
      "example": "Observe the knifeâ€™s alignment, feel the resistance, and listen for cutting sounds."
