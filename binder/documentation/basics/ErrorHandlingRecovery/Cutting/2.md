# Cutting

## Task
Cutting
## Thresholds And Metrics For Anomaly Detection
- **Cut Depth**: Monitors if the cut is too shallow or too deep compared to the intended depth.
  - Detection: Measurement tools or visual inspection show inconsistencies in the cut depth.
- **Cutting Speed**: Monitors the speed at which cutting is being done.
  - Detection: Excessively fast or slow cutting may indicate fatigue, tool issues, or improper technique.
- **Pressure Applied**: Monitors if excessive or insufficient force is applied during cutting.
  - Detection: Tactile feedback or visible tool resistance is inconsistent with typical force needed.
- **Object Movement**: Measures object stability during the cut.
  - Detection: Visual or tactile feedback indicates unwanted object movement, leading to miscuts.
- **Blade Alignment**: Checks if the blade is properly aligned with the object to ensure straight cuts.
  - Detection: Visual inspection or measurement tools show significant misalignment.
- **Cutting Tool Condition**: Monitors the condition of the cutting tool.
  - Detection: Difficulty in cutting, increased resistance, or rough edges indicate tool degradation.
- **Cut Accuracy**: Monitors the accuracy of the cut relative to the target guide or line.
  - Detection: Visual or measuring feedback shows significant misalignment from the intended path.
- **Tool Stability**: Monitors whether the tool or object remains stable during the task.
  - Detection: Tactile feedback or visual observation indicates instability or slippage.
- **Temperature Variance**: Monitors material temperature to ensure optimal cutting conditions.
  - Detection: Change in texture or resistance indicating a temperature anomaly.
- **Material Hardness**: Monitors material consistency to detect hardness discrepancies.
  - Detection: Tactile feedback or resistance changes during cutting, suggesting an unexpected material hardness.
