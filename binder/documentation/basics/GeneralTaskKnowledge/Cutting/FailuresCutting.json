    {
      "failure": "Object slips during cutting",
      "cause": "Object not properly stabilized or surface is slippery",
      "resolution": "Use a non-slip cutting board or stabilize the object with a fork or claw grip."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Uneven cuts",
      "cause": "Inconsistent pressure or improper technique",
      "resolution": "Apply steady pressure and use a guided motion or a cutting tool with adjustable guides."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Cutting tool becomes dull",
      "cause": "Tool not maintained or used improperly",
      "resolution": "Sharpen the tool regularly and avoid cutting hard, non-intended materials."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Injury to hand or fingers",
      "cause": "Improper grip or lack of attention",
      "resolution": "Use proper cutting techniques, such as the claw grip, and keep fingers clear of the blade."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Tool breaks during use",
      "cause": "Using the wrong tool for the object or applying excessive force",
      "resolution": "Select an appropriate tool for the material and ensure the tool is in good condition before use."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Object is not cut fully",
      "cause": "Insufficient force applied or wrong cutting angle",
      "resolution": "Adjust the cutting angle and apply consistent force."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Damage to the surface below",
      "cause": "Cutting through the object onto the surface",
      "resolution": "Use a cutting board or protective layer beneath the object."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Material frays or splinters",
      "cause": "Inappropriate cutting tool or technique",
      "resolution": "Use a sharp tool suitable for the material and cut in a single, smooth motion."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Cuts are not to the desired size or shape",
      "cause": "Lack of pre-planning or measurement",
      "resolution": "Measure and mark the object before cutting, or use a template for guidance."
    },
    {
      "failure": "Difficulty in cutting through tough materials",
      "cause": "Inadequate tool or insufficient force",
      "resolution": "Use a heavier-duty cutting tool or pre-score the material to make cutting easier."
