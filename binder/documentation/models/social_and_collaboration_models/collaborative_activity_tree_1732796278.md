Construct a tree diagram illustrating individual roles and shared dependencies in a collaborative activity like "building a structure."Creating a tree-based representation for a collaborative activity like "build the structure" involves mapping out the individual roles, tasks associated with these roles, and their interdependencies. Here's a possible representation:

```
Build the Structure
|
|-- Project Manager
|   |-- Define Project Scope
|   |-- Allocate Resources
|   |-- Set Deadlines
|   |-- Monitor Progress
|   |-- Coordinate Between Teams
|
|-- Architect
|   |-- Design Structure Blueprint
|   |-- Ensure Compliance with Regulations
|   |-- Revise Plans Based on Feedback
|
|-- Engineer
|   |-- Analyze Structural Integrity
|   |-- Calculate Load and Stress Factors
|   |-- Approve Materials
|   |-- Collaborate on Design Adjustments
|
|-- Construction Supervisor
|   |-- Interpret Plans and Specifications
|   |-- Schedule Construction Tasks
|   |-- Enforce Safety Procedures
|   |-- Oversee Construction Process
|
|-- Procurement Manager
|   |-- Source Materials
|   |-- Negotiate with Suppliers
|   |-- Manage Inventory
|   |-- Ensure Timely Delivery
|
|-- Site Worker Team
|   |-- Prepare Construction Site
|   |-- Operate Machinery
|   |-- Assemble and Build Structures
|   |-- Perform Quality Checks
|
`-- Shared Dependencies
    |-- Project Timeline (Project Manager <-> All)
    |-- Resource Allocation (Project Manager <-> Procurement Manager)
    |-- Design Specifications (Architect <-> Engineer <-> Construction Supervisor)
    |-- Material Availability (Procurement Manager <-> Construction Supervisor)
    |-- Compliance and Safety Standards (Engineer <-> Construction Supervisor)
    |-- Communication and Reporting Lines (All <-> Project Manager)
```

### Explanation:

- **Roles:** Each main node represents a role in the project with sub-nodes detailing tasks specific to these roles.
- **Shared Dependencies:** These are common responsibilities or tasks that require coordination between different roles. For example:
  - **Project Timeline:** Needs input and updates from all parties.
  - **Resource Allocation:** The Project Manager must coordinate closely with the Procurement Manager to ensure that materials are available as needed.
  - **Design Specifications:** The Architect's plans must be verified by the Engineer, and the Construction Supervisor must ensure they are actionable on site.
  - **Material Availability:** Directly impacts the schedule and should be closely monitored by both the Procurement Manager and Construction Supervisor.
  - **Compliance and Safety Standards:** These need collaboration between the Engineer and Construction Supervisor to ensure all standards are met during actual building processes.
  - **Communication and Reporting Lines:** The Project Manager receives regular updates from all roles to ensure the project stays on track.
