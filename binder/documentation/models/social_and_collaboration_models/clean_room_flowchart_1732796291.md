**How can I design a flowchart for a collaborative task such as 'clean the room together'? Include individual and shared subtasks with feedback loops for communication.**Creating a flowchart for a collaborative task like "Cleaning the Room Together" involves outlining various steps that individuals can take, both independently and collectively, and integrating communication feedback loops to ensure cooperation. Below is a textual representation that you can translate into a visual flowchart using flowchart software or tools like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, etc. 

### Flowchart for "Cleaning the Room Together":

1. **Start**
   - Begin the task.

2. **Initial Meeting** (Shared Task)
   - Discuss and delegate tasks.
   
3. **Task Delegation** 
   - Decide who will handle specific tasks.
     - **A**: Dusting
     - **B**: Vacuuming
     - **C**: Organizing items

4. **Feedback Loop 1**: **Communicate and Confirm Tasks**
   - Each team member confirms understanding of their task.

5. **Individual Task Nodes**
   - **Node A**: Dusting (Individual Task)
     - **Task A1**: Dust shelves
     - **Task A2**: Dust furniture
   - **Node B**: Vacuuming (Individual Task)
     - **Task B1**: Vacuum carpet
     - **Task B2**: Vacuum under furniture
   - **Node C**: Organizing (Individual Task)
     - **Task C1**: Sort items
     - **Task C2**: Arrange items

6. **Feedback Loop 2**: **Progress Check-In**
   - After initial tasks, each member reports progress:
     - If any member is behind, help redistribute tasks.

7. **Shared Task: Final Cleaning Touches**
   - Collaborate to tidy up any remaining areas (e.g., wiping surfaces, taking out trash).

8. **Feedback Loop 3**: **Final Review**
   - Conduct a walk-through together.
   - Ensure everyone is satisfied with the room's cleanliness.

9. **End**
   - Celebrate a job well done, discuss what went well, and any areas for improvement.

### Visual Representation Considerations

- **Symbols:**
  - Use **ovals** for Start and End.
  - Use **rectangles** for tasks.
  - Use **diamonds** for decision/feedback nodes.
  - Use **arrows** to indicate the flow of tasks and communication.

- **Colors:**
  - Differentiate individual tasks with one color.
  - Shared tasks and feedback loops can be another color to highlight collaboration and communication.

- **Lines & Connections:**
  - Use dotted lines to indicate communication and confirmation loops.
  - Solid arrows for task progression.

This structure can be visualized in any flowchart tool to make it a clear guide for a team cleaning a room together.
