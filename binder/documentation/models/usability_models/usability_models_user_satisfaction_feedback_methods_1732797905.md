**How do usability models include user satisfaction and what are the methods for collecting qualitative and quantitative user feedback?**## Usability Models and User Satisfaction 

Usability models incorporate user satisfaction in various ways. For instance, Nielsen's model, one of the most widely used, defines usability through learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Here, user satisfaction is a required component because it helps in determining if the system is pleasing or frustrating to use, which significantly impacts its overall success.

Another model that incorporates user satisfaction is the ISO 9241-11 model that defines usability based on effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. This model suggests that a software product is usable if it enables users to achieve specific goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specific context of use.

## Methods for Gathering User Feedback

Qualitative and quantitative feedback could be obtained from users using various methods, including:

### Quantitative Methods:

1. **Surveys & Questionnaires**: Surveys with predefined questions are one of the most popular ways to collect quantifiable data. These could include Likert scale questions to measure user satisfaction, task completion rates, or time to complete a task.

2. **Web Analytics**: Another way to collect quantitative data is through web analytics tools like Google Analytics, which let you track userâ€™s interactions, paths through the site, and more.

3. **A/B Testing**: This technique involves presenting different versions of a design to users, then collecting and analyzing the performance data of each to determine which version users prefer and which achieves the goals most efficiently.

### Qualitative Methods:

1. **User Interviews**: User interviews allow us to gather in-depth insights from users about their experiences, needs, and desires. They give us the opportunity to probe deeper than surveys, adding richer context to our understanding.

2. **Focus groups**: A focus group involves a moderator guiding an in-depth discussion with a group of users about the system in question. It enables capturing complex interactions and debates within the group, which may reveal unique perspectives and insights.

3. **Usability testing**: In usability testing, a few users try out the system under observation conditions. They are usually asked to think aloud while trying to achieve tasks that could reveal usability problems.

Remember, any successful user experience approach involves a mix of both quantitative and qualitative research methods to find the right balance between objective fact-based data and subjective human-centered insight.
