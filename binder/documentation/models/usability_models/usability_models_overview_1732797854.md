**Summarized Query:**

Can you explain the different usability models, including Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, Shackel's Usability Model, and the HEART Framework, with examples of their applications?## Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics

This model was developed by Jakob Nielsen and includes ten general principles for interaction design. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.

1. **Visibility of System Status**: The system should always keep users informed about what's going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time. For example, when a web page is loading, users should see a loading indicator.

2. **Match Between System and the Real World**: The system should speak users’ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the users. The system should also follow real-world conventions. A good example is the trash can icon on a computer that allows users to discard a file.

3. **User Control and Freedom**: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need an "emergency exit" to leave without having to go through a lengthy procedure. ‘Undo’ and ‘Redo’ buttons are good examples.

4. **Consistency and Standards**: Users shouldn't have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. For instance, in web design, hyperlinks should be consistently colored.

5. **Error Prevention**: Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. This might mean disabling a button until all necessary fields are filled out.

6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**: Objects, actions, and options should be visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Autofill options are useful in this regard.

7. **Flexibility and Ease of Use**: The system should cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Options for customization allow experienced users to speed up their workflow.

8. **Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design**: Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their visibility.

9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**: Error messages should be in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

10. **Help and Documentation**: Help and documentation can be necessary, but it should be easily searchable and provide concrete steps to follow.

## Shackel's Usability Model 

This model focuses on four primary factors:

1. **Effectiveness**: The accuracy and completeness with which users achieve their goals.

2. **Learnability**: The system should be easy to learn so that the user can begin work with a minimum delay.

3. **Memorability**: The system should be easy to remember so that the casual user is able to return to the system after a period of non-use without having to learn it all over again.

4. **Likes/Dislikes**: The system should be pleasant to use, so that users are subjectively satisfied when using it.

For example, a ride sharing app is effective if it allows users to book a ride quickly and accurately, learnable if it makes it easy for a new user to book a ride, memorable if returning users can do so without relearning, and liked if users enjoy using it.

## HEART Framework

Developed by Google, HEART stands for Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success. 

1. **Happiness**: Measures user attitudes, often collected via survey. For example, satisfaction, perceived ease of use, and net promoter score.

2. **Engagement**: Level of user involvement, typically measured via behavioral proxies such as frequency, intensity, or depth of interaction over some time period. 

3. **Adoption**: New users of a product or feature. For example, the number of accounts created in the last seven days or percentage of Gmail users who use Labels.

4. **Retention**: The rate at which existing users are returning. For example, how many of the active users from a given time period are still present in some later time period? You may be more interested in failure to retain, commonly known as churn.

5. **Task Success**: This includes traditional behavioral metrics of user experience, such as efficiency (time to complete a task), effectiveness (percent of tasks completed), and error rate.
For instance, a social media app measures happiness by user rating on the App Store, engagement by daily active users, adoption by new sign-ups, retention by the percent of users returning each week, and task success by the percent of posts made without error messages.
