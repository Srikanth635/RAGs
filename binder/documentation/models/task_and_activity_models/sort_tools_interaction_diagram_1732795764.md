**Summarized Query:**
Create a block diagram showing how subtasks, context, and verification interact in the task of sorting tools in a workshop, emphasizing their contributions to the overall goal.Creating a block diagram involves visually representing the interactions between various components. In the task of "sort the tools in the workshop," the main components can be broken down into subtasks, context, and verification. Below is a suggested block diagram representation in a textual form, as I am currently unable to draw images. You can use a diagramming tool like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or Microsoft Visio to convert this into a visual diagram:

### Explanation:

1. **Context Block**: This identifies relevant factors like tool types, usage purposes, and organizing principles which set the framework for sorting.

2. **Subtasks Block**: These represent specific actions required to achieve the task. They include:
   - **Identify Tool Types**: Gather all tools and classify them initially.
   - **Categorize Tools by Categories**: Organize based on defined criteria, such as usage or type.
   - **Arrange Tools in Assigned Locations**: Use organizing principles to store tools methodically.
   - **Label Tool Areas/Containers**: Labeling helps in future identification and maintains order.

3. **Verification Block**: This involves checking the accuracy of sorting and updating the system as necessary, ensuring the task's objective has been achieved effectively.

Using these components ensures a structured approach towards achieving the task "sort the tools in the workshop" efficiently. The subtasks contribute to the overall goal by breaking it into manageable actions that lead to a well-organized workshop.
