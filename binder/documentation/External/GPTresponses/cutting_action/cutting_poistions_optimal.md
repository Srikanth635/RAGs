### 1. **Slicing Soft Vegetables (e.g., Tomatoes)**

   - **Knife Angle**: 15–20°
   - **Pressure Points**: Light pressure on the front half (tip) of the knife.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Use a curled grip, knuckles guiding the knife edge.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Forward and downward slicing motion to prevent crushing.

### 2. **Chopping Dense Vegetables (e.g., Carrots, Potatoes)**

   - **Knife Angle**: 20–25°
   - **Pressure Points**: Firm pressure along the blade, focusing on the midpoint and heel.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Curl fingers, holding the vegetable firmly.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Use a straight downward motion, letting knife weight assist.

### 3. **Precision Cuts (e.g., Chiffonade for Herbs)**

   - **Knife Angle**: 10–15°
   - **Pressure Points**: Gentle pressure on the tip and front third of the blade.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Roll up herbs, fingers tucked for safety.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Rocking motion with the forward tip for control.

### 4. **Dicing Onions**

   - **Knife Angle**: 20° for vertical cuts, 10° for horizontal cuts.
   - **Pressure Points**: Downward pressure at the heel for vertical, light tip pressure for horizontal.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Hold the onion with fingers curled, knuckles against blade.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Downward and rocking motion for even dicing.

### 5. **Mincing Garlic**

   - **Knife Angle**: 10°
   - **Pressure Points**: Tip of the knife, with gentle back-and-forth pressure.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Hold garlic steady, fingers tucked.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Rapid rocking motion with the knife tip on the board.

---

### 6. **Julienning Vegetables (e.g., Bell Peppers)**

   - **Knife Angle**: 15–20°
   - **Pressure Points**: Steady pressure on the front half of the blade.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Secure vegetable with curled fingers.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Use forward slicing motion to create even, thin strips.

---

### 7. **Cubing Meats**

   - **Knife Angle**: 15–20°
   - **Pressure Points**: Firm pressure across the blade for each cut.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Hold the meat steady, fingers curled away from the blade.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Straight downward cuts to create uniform cubes.

---

### 8. **Slicing Bread**

   - **Knife Angle**: 10–15°
   - **Pressure Points**: Light, steady pressure along the blade edge.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Hold bread steady, fingers away from cutting area.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Gentle sawing motion with serrated knife.

---

### 9. **Filleting Fish**

   - **Knife Angle**: 10–15° for thin, delicate cuts.
   - **Pressure Points**: Light pressure on the tip and front half of the blade.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Hold fish steady, fingers curled for protection.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Slide knife along the bones, using the tip for control.

---

### 10. **Peeling Fruits and Vegetables**

   - **Knife Angle**: 5–10° for fine, shallow cuts.
   - **Pressure Points**: Light pressure on the blade edge, avoiding deep cuts.
   - **Hand Position**:
     - **Guiding Hand**: Hold item securely, fingers out of blade path.
     - **Cutting Hand**: Light, controlled strokes away from the body to peel.
