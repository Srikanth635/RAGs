### Query Summary:
Provide predicate logic axioms suitable for representing the relationships between tools, materials, and cutting techniques in terms of suitability.To represent the suitability of tools for specific materials using predicate logic, you can define a set of axioms that describe this relationship. Here's a formalized representation:

1. **Basic Predicates:**
   - `Suitable(tool, material)`: Tool is suitable for cutting the material.
   - `Unsuitable(tool, material)`: Tool is unsuitable for cutting the material.
   - `Tool(tool)`: Declares that the item is a tool.
   - `Material(material)`: Declares that the item is a material.
   - `Technique(tool, material, technique)`: A technique using a tool on a material.

2. **Axioms:**

   1. **Definitions of Suitability:**
      - A tool cannot be both suitable and unsuitable for the same material.
        \[
        \forall tool, material \, (Suitable(tool, material) \rightarrow \neg Unsuitable(tool, material))
        \]

   2. **Tool and Material Declarations:**
      - All tools and materials involved must be declared as such.
        \[
        \forall tool, material \, (Suitable(tool, material) \lor Unsuitable(tool, material) \rightarrow (Tool(tool) \land Material(material)))
        \]

   3. **Existence of Techniques:**
      - If there is a technique for a tool and material, the tool must be suitable for that material.
        \[
        \forall tool, material, technique \, (Technique(tool, material, technique) \rightarrow Suitable(tool, material))
        \]

   4. **Suitability Based on Material Types:**
      - Certain tools are universally suitable or unsuitable for specific material types (can be customized).
        \[
        \forall tool \, (Tool(tool) \land Meat(material) \rightarrow Suitable(knife, material))
        \]
        \[
        \forall tool \, (Tool(tool) \land Metal(material) \rightarrow Unsuitable(scissors, material))
        \]

   5. **Introduction of Multi-Cutting Techniques:**
      - If a tool is suitable for a composite material made from other materials, it must be suitable for at least one component.
        \[
        \forall tool, material1, material2 \, ((Suitable(tool, composite(material1, material2))) \rightarrow (Suitable(tool, material1) \lor Suitable(tool, material2)))
        \]

These axioms define a logical framework to express the relationship between tools, materials, and the techniques they are used in. They can be expanded with additional predicates and axioms for more nuanced situations as necessary.
