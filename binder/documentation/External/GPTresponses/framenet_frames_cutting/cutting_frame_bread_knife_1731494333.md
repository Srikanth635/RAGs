**How are causative and descriptive relations presented in the Cutting frame when cutting bread with a bread knife?**In the context of frame semantics, the "Cutting" frame involves understanding the entities and actions related to the activity of cutting. When describing the specific scenario of cutting bread with a bread knife, the following elements can be identified in terms of causative and descriptive relations within the frame:

### Causative Relations

1. **Agent (Cutter):** The person who is performing the action of cutting (e.g., a person using the knife to cut the bread).
2. **Instrument (Bread Knife):** The tool or instrument being used to perform the cutting (e.g., a bread knife).
3. **Action (Cutting):** The action of dividing the bread into pieces using the knife.
4. **Patient (Bread):** The object that is being acted upon, which is the bread in this case. It undergoes a change from being a whole loaf to becoming slices.

### Descriptive Relations

1. **Means:** The method or manner in which the cutting is performed, such as applying steady pressure with a sawing motion. 
2. **Result:** The outcome of the cutting action, which is typically described as slices of bread.
3. **Purpose:** The reason for cutting, such as preparing bread for consumption or presentation.
4. **Degree:** The extent or precision of the cutting, such as thin or thick slices.
5. **Surface:** This could refer to the cutting board or counter where the action takes place, providing stability during the cutting process.
6. **Manner:** Describes the characteristics of the cutting action, which could include speed (e.g., quickly or slowly) or technique (e.g., carefully, with a steady hand).

These causative and descriptive relations provide a detailed understanding of the "Cutting" frame as applied to cutting bread with a bread knife, specifying the roles and characteristics involved in this everyday scenario.
