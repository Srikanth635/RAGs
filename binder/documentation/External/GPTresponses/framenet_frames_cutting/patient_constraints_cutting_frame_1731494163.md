What are the constraints for the Patient frame element in the Cutting frame?In the FrameNet project, the "Cutting" frame represents actions or processes where an entity (the Agent) divides or separates an object (the Patient) by applying physical force, usually with an instrument. The Patient frame element, specifically, is the object that undergoes the change or division during the cutting event. Here are some of the constraints commonly associated with the Patient frame element in the Cutting frame:

1. **Affected Entity**: The Patient must be a tangible object or material that can be physically divided or separated. This typically includes objects or substances like paper, wood, fabric, etc.

2. **Separation Result**: The Patient is expected to be in a different state after the cutting event, typically divided into two or more pieces.

3. **Physical Interaction**: There must be physical contact or interaction with the Agent and the cutting instrument for the cutting action to be valid. The Patient is directly involved in this interaction.

4. **Integral State**: Before the cutting event, the Patient is usually in one piece or an intact form, and the event alters this integral state.

By adhering to these constraints, the Patient frame element is accurately represented as the target of the cutting action within the Cutting frame.
