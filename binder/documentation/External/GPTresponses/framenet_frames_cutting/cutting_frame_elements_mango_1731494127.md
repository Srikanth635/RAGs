**What are the essential components of a Cutting frame for slicing mangoes?**In Frame Semantics, as proposed by Charles Fillmore, the "Cutting" frame typically involves several core elements. When specifically applied to cutting fruits like a mango, these elements generally include:

1. **Cutter**: The entity or person performing the cutting action. For example, a person using a knife to cut the mango.

2. **Instrument**: The tool used to perform the cutting, such as a knife or a slicer.

3. **Object (or Patient)**: The entity being cut. In this case, the mango is the object of the cutting process.

4. **Parts**: The resulting parts or sections of the object after it has been cut. For mango, this could refer to slices, cubes, or wedges.

5. **Purpose**: The intended reason or use for cutting the object. For instance, the mango could be cut for immediate consumption, presentation in a fruit salad, or preparation for a recipe.

6. **Technique**: The specific method or manner in which the cutting is performed. Techniques can vary, such as slicing, dicing, or peeling.

These elements collectively help to describe the context and action of cutting, providing a comprehensive understanding of the process in frames dealing with actions like cutting fruits.
