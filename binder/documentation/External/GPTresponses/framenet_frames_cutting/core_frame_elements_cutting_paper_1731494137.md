**What are the essential components of a paper cutter?**In the context of analyzing actions such as "cutting paper," we can consider the Frame Semantics theory developed by Charles Fillmore, which identifies core frame elements involved in understanding a particular action or scenario. For the action of "cutting paper," the core frame elements are:

1. **Agent**: The individual or entity performing the action of cutting, such as a person using scissors.

2. **Instrument**: The tool or implement used for cutting, typically an object like scissors, a knife, or a paper cutter.

3. **Object**: The item being cut, in this case, the paper.

4. **Result**: The outcome of the cutting action, often including the description of how the paper is divided or altered.

These elements help establish the basic scenario surrounding the action of cutting paper, encompassing who is involved, what is being used, what is being affected, and what the expected outcome is.
