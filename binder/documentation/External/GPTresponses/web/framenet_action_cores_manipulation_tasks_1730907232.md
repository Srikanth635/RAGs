### Summary Request: FrameNet Action Cores for Manipulation Tasks

- **Detail:** Provide comprehensive descriptions of FrameNet action cores specifically for manipulation tasks like grasping, cutting, placing, pouring, and mixing.
- **Include:** Frame elements, typical instruments, and everyday examples for each action core.Certainly! FrameNet is a computational lexicography project based on frame semantics, which involves understanding the semantic and syntactic structures of words in context. In the context of manipulation tasks, FrameNet identifies "frames" that represent the conceptual structure and elements of these tasks. Here, we'll break down the frames associated with the manipulation tasks you mentioned: grasapping, cutting, placing, pouring, and mixing.

### 1. **Grasping**

#### Frame Elements
- **Agent**: The entity performing the grasping.
- **Theme**: The object being grasped.
- **Manner**: The way in which the object is grasped.
- **Purpose**: The intention behind the grasping.

#### Typical Instruments
- **Hands/Fingers**: primary means for grasping.
- **Pliers**, **Tongs**, **Clamps**: used when the object may be too small, large, or hot.

#### Common Examples
- Grasping a cup of coffee from a table.
- Using tongs to pick up hot food from a grill.

### 2. **Cutting**

#### Frame Elements
- **Agent**: The person or machine doing the cutting.
- **Patient**: The material or item being cut.
- **Instrument**: The tool used to cut.
- **Result**: The outcome of the cutting action.

#### Typical Instruments
- **Knife**, **Scissors**, **Saw**, **Blade**.

#### Common Examples
- Cutting an apple with a kitchen knife.
- Sawing wood into pieces for construction.

### 3. **Placing**

#### Frame Elements
- **Agent**: The entity responsible for placing.
- **Theme**: The object being placed.
- **Goal**: The location or condition where the object is to be placed.
- **Manner**: How the placement is executed.

#### Typical Instruments
- **Hands**, **Robotic arm**: most placements are carried out directly with the agentâ€™s appendages.
- **Spoons**, **Tongs**, if transfer of delicate or small items is involved.

#### Common Examples
- Placing a book on a shelf.
- Placing plates on a dining table.

### 4. **Pouring**

#### Frame Elements
- **Agent**: The individual or device pouring.
- **Source**: The container from which something is being poured.
- **Theme**: The substance being poured.
- **Goal**: The target container or place where the substance is directed.
- **Manner**: The style or speed of pouring.
- **Instrument**: Any tool aiding in pouring.

#### Typical Instruments
- **Pitcher**, **Carafe**, **Kettle**.
- **Funnel**: Used to direct liquid accurately in small openings.

#### Common Examples
- Pouring water from a bottle into a glass.
- Pouring pancake batter from a mixing bowl to a frying pan.

### 5. **Mixing**

#### Frame Elements
- **Agent**: The individual or device doing the mixing.
- **Theme**: The ingredients or elements being mixed.
- **Instrument**: Tools used to facilitate mixing.
- **Manner**: The technique or speed of mixing.
- **Purpose**: The intended outcome of mixing the ingredients.

#### Typical Instruments
- **Spoon**, **Whisk**, **Mixer**.

#### Common Examples
- Mixing salad ingredients in a bowl.
- Mixing dough for bread using a stand mixer.

These frames provide a schematic understanding of various everyday actions, detailing their components and typical behaviors associated with these tasks. Each frame can involve variations and expansions depending on the context and complexity of the task at hand.
