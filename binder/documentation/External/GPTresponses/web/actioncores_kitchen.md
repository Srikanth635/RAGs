## FrameNet Action Cores for Kitchen Manipulation Tasks

Kitchen manipulation tasks involve a range of actions typically performed in food preparation, cooking, and handling utensils. In FrameNet, **action cores** define the essential structure of these actions, specifying key roles like **Agent** (the one performing the action), **Theme** (the object being manipulated), **Instrument** (the tool used), and **Goal** (the desired outcome or location).
