#### 3. **Pushing**
   - **Main Participants:**
     - **Agent:** The initiator of the push.
     - **Theme:** The object being pushed.
     - **Goal:** The intended new location or position of the object.
   - **Example Task:**
     - **Pushing a cart** in a supermarket or in a manufacturing setting to transport goods.

#### 4. **Pulling**
   - **Main Participants:**
     - **Agent:** The entity performing the pulling.
     - **Theme:** The item being pulled.
     - **Goal:** The desired location to which the item is being pulled.
   - **Example Task:**
     - **Pulling cables** through conduits in construction or maintenance tasks.

#### 5. **Turning**
   - **Main Participants:**
     - **Agent:** The entity responsible for the turning action.
     - **Theme:** The object being turned.
   - **Example Task:**
     - **Turning a valve or knob** in industrial control settings to regulate flow or functionality.

#### 6. **Inserting**
   - **Main Participants:**
     - **Agent:** The performer of the insertion.
     - **Theme:** The object being inserted.
     - **Goal:** The receptacle or location in which the object is to be inserted.
   - **Example Task:**
     - **Assembly lines** where components are inserted into products or machinery, such as inserting a battery into a phone.

#### 7. **Unfastening**
   - **Main Participants:**
     - **Agent:** The operator of the unfastening.
     - **Theme:** The item being unfastened (like a bolt).
     - **Instrument:** Tools used (if any, like a wrench).
   - **Example Task:**
     - **Vehicle maintenance** tasks that involve unfastening bolts or screws during repairs or inspections.

Each of these cores involves interactions between the agent and the theme, often employing tools (instruments) and aimed towards achieving a specific placement or configuration (goal).FrameNet is a linguistic resource that defines various action cores, or frames, which describe different types of events, actions, or relationships along with their participants. Several action cores are especially relevant to manipulation tasks. Here are some of these cores, their main participants, and examples of typical real-world tasks that utilize each frame:

### 1. **Applying**
**Main Participants:**
- **Agent:** The entity performing the action.
- **Theme:** The substance or item being applied.
- **Goal:** The surface or object to which the theme is applied.

**Example Tasks:**
- **Painting a wall:** Here, the painter is the Agent, paint is the Theme, and the wall is the Goal.
- **Applying thermal paste on a CPU:** In this case, the technician is the Agent, the thermal paste is the Theme, and the CPU is the Goal.

### 2. **Attaching**
**Main Participants:**
- **Agent:** The entity doing the attaching.
- **Theme:** The item being attached.
- **Goal:** The object to which the Theme is being attached.

**Example Tasks:**
- **Affixing a poster to a wall:** The person placing the poster is the Agent, the poster is the Theme, and the wall is the Goal.
- **Securing a hard drive in a computer case:** The technician is the Agent, the hard drive is the Theme, and the computer case is the Goal.

### 3. **Removing**
**Main Participants:**
- **Agent:** The entity performing the removal.
- **Theme:** The item being removed.
- **Source:** The location or object from which the theme is removed.

**Example Tasks:**
- **Unscrewing a bolt:** The mechanic is the Agent, the bolt is the Theme, and its previous position is the Source.
- **Deleting software from a computer:** Here, the user (or uninstallation software) functions as the Agent, the software as the Theme, and the computer as the Source.

### 4. **Manipulating**
**Main Participants:**
- **Agent:** The entity manipulating an object.
- **Theme:** The object being manipulated.

**Example Tasks:**
- **Adjusting a thermostat:** The person changing settings is the Agent, and the thermostat is the Theme.
- **Operating a drone:** The operator is the Agent, and the drone is the Theme.

### 5. **Transporting**
**Main Participants:**
- **Agent:** The entity moving something from one place to another.
- **Theme:** The item being transported.
- **Source:** Where the transport begins.
- **Goal:** The transport’s destination.

**Example Tasks:**
- **Delivering mail:** The postal worker is the Agent, mail is the Theme, the post office is the Source, and the recipient’s mailbox is the Goal.
- **Moving furniture to a new home:** The mover is the Agent, the furniture is the Theme, the old home is the Source, and the new home is the Goal.

### Utilization

These action cores and their associated participants help linguists and AI developers understand how different tasks can be framed and described. This understanding aids in natural language processing tasks, robotics, and automated systems programming, allowing for a more natural interaction with technology by using language that aligns with human cognitive frameworks.
