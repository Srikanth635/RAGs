## FrameNet Action Cores

FrameNet is a lexical database that models the semantics of words by categorizing them into **frames**. Each frame represents a conceptual structure involving **participants** and **actions** associated with a particular situation or activity. Within these frames, **action cores** are crucial elementsâ€”they represent the primary action or event, which gives the frame its essential meaning.

In FrameNet, action cores help identify the fundamental components involved in actions or events, typically involving an **Agent** (the entity performing the action) and **Patient** (the entity affected by the action), along with other frame elements as needed.

Here are some key FrameNet action cores and the roles they typically involve:

---

### 1. **Cause_harm**
   - **Description**: This frame involves an action where an agent causes harm or damage to a patient.

     - **Instrument**: The object or method used to inflict harm.
   - **Example**: "The attacker *injured* the victim with a knife."

---

### 2. **Cause_motion**
   - **Description**: Represents actions where an agent causes an entity to move from one location to another.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity causing the motion.

     - **Addressee**: The recipient of the information.
     - **Message**: The content of the communication.
   - **Example**: "The manager *informed* the team about the new policy."

### 4. **Perception_active**
   - **Description**: Represents an agent actively perceiving an object or phenomenon.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Perceiver**: The entity actively perceiving.
     - **Phenomenon**: The object or event being perceived.
   - **Example**: "She *observed* the animal in the forest."

---

### 5. **Ingest_substance**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent consuming a substance.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Ingestor**: The entity consuming the substance.
     - **Ingestibles**: The substance being consumed.
   - **Example**: "The child *drank* the milk."

---

### 6. **Apply_heat**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent applying heat to an object, often for cooking or industrial processes.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity applying heat.
     - **Theme**: The object being heated.
     - **Instrument**: The source of heat (e.g., stove, fire).
   - **Example**: "The chef *grilled* the vegetables over an open flame."

---

### 7. **Transfer_ownership**
   - **Description**: Describes the transfer of ownership of an object from one party to another.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Giver**: The entity transferring ownership.
     - **Recipient**: The entity receiving ownership.
     - **Theme**: The object being transferred.
   - **Example**: "She *sold* the car to her neighbor."

---

### 8. **Creating**
   - **Description**: Involves an agent bringing something into existence.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Creator**: The entity creating something.
     - **Creation**: The object or product being created.
   - **Example**: "The artist *painted* a landscape."

---

### 9. **Destroying**
   - **Description**: This frame involves an agent causing the destruction of an entity.
   - **Core Elements**:
     - **Agent**: The entity causing destruction.
     - **Patient**: The entity being destroyed.
   - **Example**: "The bulldozer *demolished* the old building."

---

### 10. **Motion**
   - **Description**: This frame involves an entity moving from one place to another on its own.

     - **Source**: The starting location of the motion.
     - **Goal**: The destination of the motion.
   - **Example**: "The cat *leaped* onto the windowsill."

### Summary

These action cores in FrameNet define the essential structures needed to represent various types of actions and events. By breaking down each action into core components (e.g., Agent, Patient, Theme), FrameNet helps create a more comprehensive understanding of how different roles participate in events, which is highly valuable for applications like natural language understanding, semantic analysis, and information extraction.
