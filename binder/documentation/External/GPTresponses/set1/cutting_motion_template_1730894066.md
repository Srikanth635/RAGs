Extract the template for cutting motion patterns.The act of cutting involves specific mechanical motions that are characteristic of the task. Here is a template that describes the typical motions involved in cutting actions:

1. **Approach**:
   - **Orientation**: Position and orient the tool toward the material to be cut.
   - **Alignment**: Ensure the cutting edge is properly aligned with the desired cut line.

2. **Contact**:
   - **Initial Touch**: Bring the cutting tool lightly into contact with the material at the starting point of the cut.

3. **Cutting**:
   - **Penetration**: Apply force to push or draw the cutting edge into the material.
   - **Motion**: Execute the primary cutting motion. This may involve:
     - **Linear Motion**: Moving the tool in a straight line (e.g., slicing with a knife).
     - **Rotational Motion**: Turning the tool for circular cuts (e.g., using scissors or a pizza cutter).
     - **Reciprocating Motion**: Back-and-forth or sawing actions (e.g., hand saw or electric jigsaw).

4. **Controlling**:
   - **Force Application**: Adjust the amount of force applied based on material resistance.
   - **Speed Regulation**: Control cutting speed to improve cut quality and tool wear.
   - **Adjustment**: Make minor adjustments to maintain the line of cut as needed.

5. **Completion**:
   - **Finish Cut**: Follow through to the end of the material or desired stopping point.
   - **Debrief**: Withdraw the tool from the cut and inspect the cut quality for precision and finish.

6. **Post-Cutting**:
   - **Clean-up**: Remove any debris or excess material.
   - **Tool Maintenance**: Clean, sharpen, or otherwise maintain the cutting tool for future use.

This template outlines the general process, although specific cutting actions may vary depending on the tool being used and the material being cut (e.g., paper, fabric, metal, wood, etc.).
