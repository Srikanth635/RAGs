**Query:** How can predicate logic be used to represent multi-agent collaborative tasks in manipulation, including axioms for cooperation, task division, and dependencies?In representing multi-agent tasks with predicate logic, we aim to formalize the collaborative efforts of multiple agents working towards a common manipulation task. The goal is to capture the concepts of cooperation, task division, and dependencies between agents. Below, I'll outline a set of axioms that can be used to model these concepts:

### Basic Predicates

- **Agent(x):** x is an agent.
- **Task(t):** t is a task.
- **Performs(agent, task):** agent performs a part of task.
- **SubTask(t, st):** st is a subtask of task t.
- **Requires(task, resource):** task requires the resource.
- **Cooperates(agent1, agent2, task):** agent1 cooperates with agent2 to perform task.
- **CanComplete(agent, task):** agent is capable of completing task independently.

### Axioms for Cooperation

1. **Mutual Cooperation:**  
   If two agents cooperate on a task, then each performs a subtask that contributes to the overall task:
   \[
   \forall a1, a2, t \, (Cooperates(a1, a2, t) \rightarrow \exists st1, st2 \, (SubTask(t, st1) \land SubTask(t, st2) \land Performs(a1, st1) \land Performs(a2, st2)))
   \]

2. **Shared Goal:**  
   Cooperation implies pursuit of a shared goal:
   \[
   \forall a1, a2, t \, (Cooperates(a1, a2, t) \rightarrow (\exists goal \, (Goal(t, goal) \land Achieves(a1, goal) \land Achieves(a2, goal))))
   \]

### Axioms for Task Division

3. **Task Division into Subtasks:**  
   A complex task can be divided into non-overlapping subtasks:
   \[
   \forall t \, (Task(t) \rightarrow \exists st1, st2, \ldots, stn \, (SubTask(t, st1) \land SubTask(t, st2) \land \ldots \land Disjoint(st1, st2, \ldots, stn)))
   \]
   Where **Disjoint(st1, st2, …, stn)** expresses that the subtasks do not overlap.

4. **Exclusive Performance Requirement:**  
   Each subtask of a complex task should be performed by at most one agent:
   \[
   \forall st, a1, a2 \, ((Performs(a1, st) \land Performs(a2, st)) \rightarrow a1 = a2)
   \]

### Axioms for Dependencies

5. **Dependency in Subtasks:**  
   Completion of a task depends on certain dependencies among the subtasks:
   \[
   \forall t, st1, st2 \, ((SubTask(t, st1) \land SubTask(t, st2) \land DependsOn(st2, st1)) \rightarrow Completed(st1) \rightarrow Completed(st2))
   \]
   Where **DependsOn(st2, st1)** indicates that subtask st2 depends on the completion of subtask st1.

6. **Agent Dependency:**  
   If an agent’s task completion depends on another’s, then the second agent must perform the dependent subtask:
   \[
   \forall a1, a2, t, st1, st2 \, ((Performs(a1, st1) \land Dependent(a2, a1, st2, st1)) \rightarrow Performs(a2, st2))
   \]

### Flexible Roles

7. **Role Flexibility:**  
   Agents can assume flexible roles as task requirements evolve:
   \[
   \forall a, t1, t2 \, ((CanComplete(a, t1) \land CanComplete(a, t2)) \rightarrow (Performs(a, t1) \lor Performs(a, t2)))
   \]

This set of logical predicates and axioms provides a foundation to model and analyze cooperation, task division, and dependencies in multi-agent systems. These logical representations can be used to verify, simulate, or reason about the efficiency and feasibility of collaborative efforts in complex tasks.
